    <article class="entry-post">
      <p>A beginners guide to Pinterest. This guide everything you need to know in order to set up and grow a Pinterest account that is going to work for you and your business.</p>

<p>Pinterest is an extremely powerful tool. Personally, I receive almost 1 million page views on Pinterest every month. That number is constantly growing and I have been able to use that traffic to grow my personal blog and business. I have harnessed the power of Pinterest to grow my email list, to grow my personal loyal following and to help others succeed. Besides just helping myself in this process, I also work as a Pinterest Strategist and Marketer for other bloggers and online businesses. Doing so has helped me to grow an audience that wants to learn more about Pinterest, that’s why I want to break it all down for you here. I am not special, as much as it pains me to admit that, but I am not. Pinterest growth is something everyone can achieve.</p>

<p>First things first, <strong>Pinterest is not another social media network.</strong> Please do not lump it in with Instagram and Facebook and Twitter. If you do that, then you are using the platform all wrong and you aren’t going to see results. If you want real results from this platform you have to start using it like a search engine. Search engines are tools like Google and Yahoo and Microsoft Edge. They are a platform where a user types in a search and the engine that they are using has a specific algorithm to help that user get the most accurate results in the least amount of time. The only difference between Pinterest and Google is that Pinterest is an extremely visual search engine, and google is not.</p>

<h4 id="treating-pinterest-like-a-search-engine">Treating Pinterest like a Search Engine</h4>

<p>When you start treating Pinterest like a search engine you also have to start thinking about your keywords. If you are a beginner on Pinterest then this is the number one place you need to start. If you’ve been attempting to work on Pinterest for  a while now then I want you to go back through every single blog post you have and work on this. Every blog post that you write should contain keywords. Keywords are the things that search engines look for when they are scanning for results to give a user. If you aren’t using keywords, then your blogs are never going to show up in search results. For every blog post you write, you need to be doing keyword research and then you need to be using those keywords correctly.</p>

<h4 id="your-business-account">Your Business Account</h4>

<p>Next you need to convert your account to a business account. Or if you want, you can start an entirely new account for your blog or business. Pinterest business accounts are free to sign up for and they are important for tracking and understanding your audience. There are a few things that you should consider when you are deciding whether to convert your account or start a new one.</p>

<p>The first of those considerations is the username. If you convert your account you cannot change the username. This means that you have to keep the personal username you set up for yourself. This worked for me because my Pinterest username was Justynjen and I decided to call my business Justynjen so the conversion was simple. (The username shows up at https://pinterest.com/justynjen) If your business name is XYZ Business and your username is Justynjen then you might want to start a new account so your username is https://pinterest.com/XYZBusiness.</p>

<p>If the username is going to stay the same then you can convert your account which means that you are going to get to keep the audience that you have already built on your personal account. However this also means that you are going to have to work to clean up your account. You need to make your account business focuses so it’s time to hide all those boards and pins that aren’t related.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.subscribepage.com/pinterest-for-business-download" target="_blank">Download my free guide on how to convert and clean up your Pinterest account.</a></strong></p>

<p>With a Business Account you can now track your analytics, see who your audience is and gain domain authority. If you need help with converting your account or account cleanup, email me at <a href="hello@justynjen.com" target="_blank">hello@justynjen.com</a> as account cleanup is a one time service that I offer for my clients.</p>

<p>Next, in order to gain domain authority you need to claim your website on Pinterest. My above guide can help you do that or I can if you book a Pinterest clean up session with me.</p>

<h4 id="pin-design">Pin Design</h4>

<p>Let’s backtrack to where I said that they biggest difference between Pinterest and Google was that Pinterest is an extremely visual experience for users. I want to walk you through the usability of Pinterest because it’s an important step to understand for your business.</p>

<h5 id="how-pinterest-works-for-consumers">How Pinterest works for consumers:</h5>

<ol>
  <li>A user has a need.</li>
  <li>The user goes to Pinterest in search of an answer or solution to that need.</li>
  <li>When the user types in the keywords they are searching for, Pinterest spits out the most relevant information (you will show up if you have been using good SEO practices).</li>
  <li>The user then gets shown their choices in the form of visual pins.</li>
  <li>Users are going to pick the pin that stands out to them the most. They are going to pick the pin that has the best title, the best design, the prettiest picture. The pin that’s the easiest to understand or the pin that clearly shows them they are going to get the answer they are looking for.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore your pins have to be exactly what they are looking for. Your pins have to be clear but well designed. They have to be beautiful but easy to understand. There is an art to creating the perfect pin.</p>

<p>In my new <a href="https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook-course" target="_blank">Pinterest Playbook course</a>, I do an entire video on creating the perfect Pin in Canva. You want your pin to be original and branded. People should know that it’s your pin because it looks like your brand. Then, when people start to recognize your pins, they will know that you are a trusted resource and they are way more likely to click over to your website.</p>

<h4 id="converting-your-traffic">Converting your traffic</h4>

<p>The last thing that I want to go over in this guide is how to convert your traffic. It’s great that you are getting thousands of views on Pinterest but it means very little if that traffic isn’t converting over to your website. Being a beginner on Pinterest just means that you get the chance to do these things right from the beginning. You get to grow your Pinterest following and be growing your blog audience at the same time.</p>

<p>In order to start growing your email list you need to create an opt in, a reason for people to join your list. People want to get something in return for signing up so make sure that when you are creating your opt in, that you are solving a problem for them. Then you need to promote your opt in on Pinterest. The quickest way that you can do this is by creating a landing page within your email service that will collect their email and then in turn send them the freebie. Then you have to create a pin for this landing page, describing what the freebie is and post that pin on Pinterest. Link that pin to the landing page and you’re ready to go. Don’t put this off. You should be looking to grow your email list along with your Pinterest account, especially if you are just starting out.</p>

<p>This beginners guide to Pinterest has taken you through all the steps to creating a profitable blog and Pinterest account at the same time but I want to leave you with one last reminder. SEO and domain authority take time to build up. You are never going to see instant and long lasting success overnight from Pinterest. You might have a pin that goes <strong>viral,</strong> but it is so so important that you are preparing for that so when your pin goes viral, it creates hype around you and your business and not just around the pin. Always be working to convert your audience onto your platform.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are willing to put in the time on Pinterest and really do the work.
