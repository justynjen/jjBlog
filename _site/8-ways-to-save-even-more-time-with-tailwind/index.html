    <article class="entry-post">
      <p>The best thing about Tailwind is that it saves you SO much time on Pinterest and it helps you grow your reach and engagement massively. If you haven’t read my beginners’ guide to Tailwind yet, I urge you to check it out first. Then come back here and learn how to save even more time through this platform. </p>

<p>What I love about Tailwind is the amount of time it saves me every week. I am able to schedule my own and my clients pins every week and it only takes me a couple of hours. Then I can get back to creating more amazing content and practicing new strategies for the future. </p>

<h4 id="lets-get-started-talking-about-tailwind">Let’s get started talking about Tailwind. </h4>

<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I’m an affiliate for Tailwind and will earn a referral fee if you sign up via my link. You can schedule and publish 100 Pins FREE! If you purchase a plan, you won’t pay a cent more by using my link. Thanks for your support!</em></p>

<p>Just a recap for those of you who are new here, I am a Pinterest Strategist. I offer consultations and programs to help you grow your blog and online business through Pinterest and I have an online shop FULL of educational resources and templates to help you grow even more. </p>

<p>In this post I am going to be sharing 8 ways that you can save <em>even more</em> time on Pinterest by using Tailwind. </p>

<p>You can start saving even more time on Tailwind by setting up board lists. These are a way for you to add all the relevant boards to a single list. This comes in handy for scheduling. </p>

<p>The next time that you want to schedule a pin, instead of sorting through every board you want to add that pin too, you just click the name of the board list that you created. That adds all boards to the pin automatically.</p>

<p>Another way to save time is to use the interval scheduling. Once you have clicked for your board list and added all of the boards to that pin, you should use an interval to separate them so that all your pins don’t spam your audience and boards all at once. </p>

<p>After you have set the interval you can hit Schedule now and all those pins will be added to your smart queue.</p>

<p>The smart queue is one of the best ways that you can save time on Tailwind. The smart schedule picks the perfect times for you to pin. Next time you go to save a pin, just click at to queue and it schedules it at the perfect time for you. </p>

<p>Another time saving secret to Tailwind is being released in waves for Beta testing at the moment. This is the Smart Loop. Smart Loop’s are amazing and I have been waiting for Tailwind to roll out this feature for the whole year basically. When you use a smart loop, you add your pins, your boards and board rules and Tailwind does the rest. It will recirculate your relevant content so you never have to worry about doing it yourself again. (Smart Loop also gives you data about each pin so that you can hone in on what’s working the best for you.)</p>

<p>You can also save time on using Tailwind by keeping an eye on your analytics. How does this save you time? Well when you track your analytics, you can better see what your audience wants. And when you know what your audience wants, you can stop spending time creating content that isn’t going to get you anywhere. You can create content that’s going to grow your business and you can create that content even faster.</p>

<p>Batching your content and shuffling your queue is going to change the way that you use Tailwind. When you have a massive schedule you might find that you are still spending so much time filling up your queue every week. Batching your pins is the best way to combat this! </p>

<h5 id="different-ways-that-you-can-batch-your-content-include">Different ways that you can batch your content include: </h5>

<ul>
  <li>Batching from your group boards. This is also a great way to make sure that you are sharing enough content and engaging in groups enough. </li>
  <li>Batching content from your favorite bloggers. I have a few bloggers that I love and am always happy to engage with. When I know they have a lot of content out, I will go batch through all of their content and share tons of their pins at once.</li>
  <li>Batch your content by category. This is an awesome way to fill up new boards. I will often search Pinterest by category and fill up an entire board with 50 new pins. </li>
</ul>

<p>After you batch a ton of content, make sure that you shuffle your queue. This helps your content look more spread out. This way your audience doesn’t see 100 pins from one blogger or topic all at once. I like to do this because it makes my content look more natural. </p>

<h4 id="how-to-save-time-on-tailwind-with-tribes">How to save time on Tailwind with Tribes</h4>

<p>You can save tons of time of Tailwind by accessing the full power of Tribes. Tribes help you to reach your niche audience but they also help you find tons of pins that you’re going to want to share. When I am batching my content, I often go to Tribes and share a lot of content from Tribe members all at once. I scroll through all of the new Tribe content. It’s such a quick and easy way to fill up your queue. Plus, when you engage in a Tribe, people are way more likely to engage with you. </p>

<p>Tribes can also save you time on Tailwind by getting you even faster engagement. Faster engagement helps you to get faster results and that in and of itself will save you so much time. </p>

<p>Another way that Tailwind saves you time with pinning is by flagging pins that link back to spam, don’t have a description or that don’t have a valid link. You can save time because you won’t have to worry about pinning dangerous and spam links that will dock you points on Pinterest. Tailwind catches these things for you and flags them. They then don’t pin and instead they show up in a separate tab for you to review.</p>

<p>The last way that you are going to save time on Tailwind is by batching your day. By this I mean you need to schedule time at the beginning of the week to sit down and do nothing but pin. I generally pick an hour every Monday morning, right after my breakfast and coffee, to sit down and do nothing but pin. Then, you are done using Pinterest for the entire week. One thing you can tick off and forget about until next week. This is my favorite thing about Tailwind. </p>
