      <h4 id="my-solo-trip-to-japan">My solo trip to Japan!</h4>

<p>Temples, Shrines, Bullet Trains, Stardom..</p>

<p>Need I say more?</p>

<p>Here is my recent trip to Japan, what I did and why you should definitely go solo!</p>

<p>I just recently took the most amazing solo trip to Japan. For those of you girls out there who want to take your first solo trip, Japan is the place to do it. I love traveling solo and before I left, everyone told me not to travel alone to Japan. They never said it was dangerous, cause it’s 100% not, they just said I would be alone A LOT. That it’s not the place you go to meet people. I thought that wouldn’t be too bad, so I could get lots of work done. That wasn’t the case though! While I was alone a lot while I was in the less traveled Western Japan, I met loads of people and I became friends with some amazing Japanese people that endured our language barrier and we were able to really get to know each other. Japan is one of the best places that I have been too. It is just unreal. You can wander aimlessly through giant metropolises, sit quietly in the ambiance of shrines, temples and giant Buddha’s and eat anything and everything that you may have ever wanted to eat. From Octopus balls, to conveyor sushi to ramen to giant robots and monster cafes; Japan has it all. </p>

<h4 id="tokyo">Tokyo</h4>

<p>My trip was fast and furious. I got to see a lot in a short time. I started my trip in Tokyo; the concrete jungle. In Tokyo I embraced everything Japanese with wandering through the giant buildings to praying quietly in a Shrine just across the street from one of the busiest places I have ever been. I am not usually a fan of big cities, but Tokyo is a must.</p>

<h4 id="nikko">Nikko</h4>

<p>Next stop; Nikko. Make sure to hop on a train from Tokyo one morning to check out this city full to the brim of temples and shrines, monkeys and mountains. You can visit all the shrines and then take the bus to the lake to enjoy some waterfalls and great views of the mountains.</p>

<p>I headed back to Tokyo for the night and then the next morning I headed on the train out to Hakone. I was looking forward to seeing Mt Fuji and relaxing the night away in a traditional Onsen!</p>

<h4 id="matsumoto">Matsumoto</h4>

<p>After 2 nights in Hakone and lots of hiking, I decided to head onwards to Matsumoto. Matsumoto was a dream. The castle there is so beautiful, especially at night. After walking through the castle you can visit the museum there, have some tea at a traditional tea ceremony and walk through the adorable shopping street. Where I got some perfect sushi washi tape perfect for adding memories and mementos to my journal.</p>

<h4 id="kurobe-alpine-route-to-kanazawa">Kurobe Alpine Route to Kanazawa</h4>

<p>In the morning from Matsumoto I did the Kurobe Alpine route to Kanazawa. I was able to see the Kurobe Dam, the gorgeous mt (whatever) and the snow wall! I spent the following couple of nights in Kanazawa.  Known best for its sushi, I helped myself to lots of that and managed to try some kinds that I wouldn’t have otherwise eaten, so it was fun. Make sure to check out the gardens and castle there, the gardens are one of the top in Japan and the castle is just as beautiful as you would expect. You can also wander through the geisha district and the samarui districts that are unlike any other!</p>

<h4 id="shirakawa-go">Shirakawa-Go</h4>

<p>Enroute to Takayama I made a stop at Shirakawa, a unesco world heritage site. The  bus ride is only an hour from Kanazawa and then another hour afterwards to Takayama. I just was able to buy my tickets at the station.</p>

<h4 id="takayama">Takayama</h4>

<p>From there I headed to Takayama, where I was able to ride a bike all over, visit the teddy bear museum and café, and explore tons of the cutest little streets that I have been too. Takayama was beautiful and while you can see plenty of beautiful things, I was also able to catch up on writing and relax for a bit.</p>

<h4 id="kyoto">Kyoto</h4>

<p>I was going to need a bit of rest because next I was off to Kyoto where there is so much to do and see that relaxing was not going to be one of them. Kyoto is rather large, and you can basically take a bsu to anywhere you’d like with a day pass of only 500 yen. It’s your best bet in this huge and beautiful city. Make sure not to miss the golden temple, the Shrine and the largest Pagoya in Japan.</p>

<h4 id="hiroshima">Hiroshima</h4>

<p>From Kyoto I took the bullet train to Hiroshima, which was my favorite day on my trip. I was able to learn and see so much in that day, it was truly amazing. I didn’t get up as early as I had hoped, and it did pour rain all day, but every bit of that made the experience that much better. I visited the Memorial Peace Park, the museum and the A-bomb Dome.</p>

<h4 id="nara">Nara</h4>

<p>I took the train that night to Nara, for deer and the last of the temples and shrines I would see. Nara was the capital of Japan at one point, but now it is a relatively small and extremely beautiful city with wild deer roaming free, waiting for the next tourist with a selfie stick and biscuit to come along. It is also home to the second largest Pagoya in Japan and sushi. Which is sushi wrapped in leaves (don’t eat the leaves)</p>

<p>I spent a full day exploring Nara before jumping on the bullet train back to Tokyo for one more day in the big city before finally flying out.</p>

<p>So why should you go to Japan by yourself? Well for one, it’s so safe. I never once felt like I was in any sort of danger. Even though people do not speak the best English and I know 5 words in Japanese, they are so helpful and some of the kindest and happiest people that I have had the privilege to meet.</p>

<p>Travel around Japan is extremely easy. They have trains that go everywhere and with the Japan Rail pass you can get on most of them without having a reservation and get to every corner of the country. I loved it because money was not an issue; I had the freedom to go where I wanted, when I wanted. It gave me the freedom to go places I may have not gone if I had to pay for each ticket. It is definitely a must!</p>

<p>Japan did give me a lot of free time to self-reflect and debate my future while I wandered through silent shrines by myself while on the flip side I laughed over ramen and seared tuna with incredible people that I met in every city I stayed in. So to everyone who told me not to go to Japan alone, you were wrong. I would say Japan is one of the best countries for a girl to travel solo in.</p>

<p>Leaving Japan is not easy. I am going to miss smiling Japanese people, my temporary fame just for having curly unkept blonde hair, matcha everything, THE BEST SUSHI, temples, Buddhas, deer and all the amazing people that I have met, that made this solo trip the best yet. A huge thanks to Japan, Japanese people and the JR pass for making this trip 100% unforgettable. I cannot wait for my next time here.</p>
