    </div>

    <article class="entry-post">
      <p>Today I want to talk about how doing a blogging retreat changed me as a blogger. Cause let’s be honest – 2 years ago none of you viewers had ever even heard of my little piece of the internet. I attended a blogging retreat with the Institute of Code and the Blonde Abroad. The coolest thing about it is that I was being taught by two different women entrepreneurs, and I learned how to run a kick ass business. That’s right. Blogging is a business and I’ll punch you in the face if you tell me it’s not. Enough of that, here’s 10 things I learned that changed the way I blog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bali/kierstenPiggy.jpg" alt="A photo of my and Kiersten from the blogging retreat" class="blogPage-image" /></p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="1-pinterest-rocks">1. Pinterest Rocks</h3>

<p>Since my retreat I started using Pinterest for more than just trip planning and my following has gone up a bit, but more importantly, my monthly views have gone from 100 to 10,000!!! GIRLS! (AND GUYS) Use Pinterest to your advantage. It is a miraculous way to grow your views.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="2-participate-online">2. Participate online</h3>

<p>I don’t know why, but I thought viewers would just happen upon me even if i didn’t tell a single person that I blogged. Clearly I was an amazing blogger so people would just find me and BAM! Subcscribe. Basically my mom was my only subscriber for 2 years. There is an amazing community of people out there that actually want to follow along but they can’t if you don’t tell them about yourself. This is one great groups you can participate in if you would like to get you started!!</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="3-read-other-blogs-yo">3. Read other blogs yo</h3>

<p>I read all my friends blogs now, and share their posts and guess what! They share mine too. Blogging is a community and if you refuse to participate then people aren’t going to want to participate with you. Plus by reading other people’s blogs you can gather information about countries you haven’t yet traveled too and you can get inspired.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="4-schedule-everything-out">4. Schedule everything out</h3>

<p>Get a program and schedule everything. I haven’t been using twitter, or Facebook, or Pinterest because I really felt like I had no time. However, you can and should be using them all. Sign up for a scheduling service and then a few times a week you can sit down and schedule all your posts. I now use <a href="http://tailwinds.com">tailwinds</a> and it is a game changer!</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="5-seo-matters">5. SEO Matters</h3>

<p>Yah I know………… I was stupid. Of course SEO matters!! SEO, search engine optimization, is what helps google rank you among all the other google things. You want to have a good SEO so that you rank higher on google and drive more traffic to your site or business. I guess I just needed to hear it from the professionals. Using SEO can be difficult to incorporate sometimes into your writing though because you want to be as specific as you can. For example: when someone google searches “cafes in Paris”, 3 billion things are going to pop up, but if someone googles “cafes with good wifi in Paris”, you want to have those long tail keywords in your writing so you pop up. I haven’t been giving two craps about SEO and now I use it EVERYDAY and I have so many more page views that I feel actually successful!</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="6-be-yourself">6. Be YOURSELF</h3>

<p>There are about 100 million travel bloggers and 600 million other bloggers out there. So being just like them ain’t gonna cut it. You have to be yourself and be unique so that your audience loves to hear what you have to say and how you say it about a destination. They will want to tell their friends. They will want to read every week what you are up too. This is what you want in an audience. So make sure that you are being yourself so they can LOVE you.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="7-write-every-day">7. Write Every day.</h3>

<p>Yup it’s a lot of work to be a blogger. You really should be writing something down every day to keep those blogger juices flowing. An awesome mentor we had told us to start every day with some morning pages. This means that every morning you sit down undisturbed and free flow write everything that you have on your mind. I have actually come up with some awesome blog posts this way. Do it. Trust me.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="8-take-a-lot-of-photos">8. Take a lot of photos</h3>

<h4 id="and-dont-apologize-for-it">and don’t apologize for it.</h4>

<p>All those people that think you are weird for taking 100 thousand photos of yourself drinking coffee are just jealous that they don’t have the perfect coffee drinking photo. Ignore the haters, take all the photos that you want and need. People are very visual and they just love to scroll through beautiful photos on the internet when they are sad about their lives and the fact that they can’t travel. Give them something great to look at and don’t be embarrassed that it took you 59 tries.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="9-keep-on-keepin-on">9. Keep on Keepin’ on</h3>

<p>Don’t give up. Blogging is hard. Everyone is struggling along so you just keep working hard at it. Image one of those inspirational posters that says “If Walt Disney quit after people trashed his theme park idea, there would be no DisneyLand.” If you want to win, treat your blog like the next Disney World. I am going to call mine Justyn World.</p>

<h3 class="shorelines" id="10-have-all-the-fun">10. Have all the fun!!</h3>

<p>Lastly make sure that you are having fun. Cause what’s the point of blogging if you aren’t having fun? Your fun comes out in your writing as well. If you hate what you do, do something new. Didn’t we all get into this field because we wanted to break away from that 9 to 5 and do what really excites us?! If blogging has stopped exciting you, then fight like hell to get that excitement back. Otherwise… Go work at the bank.</p>

<h4 id="but-how-has-it-helped-me">But how has it helped me?</h4>

<p>How does all this make me a better blogger? Well let me tell you my personal story. I have been blogging for over two years. That’s a long time. Two years ago when I started I thought for sure that by now, life would be golden. I didn’t realize that I was doing it all wrong. I didn’t realize the amount of hard work people were actually putting into all of this. So basically I spent two years getting no where. And now, just two months after my retreat I am collaborating with brands here in Bali, I am writing more, getting loads of engagement and I am back to having a blast!! My page views have gone up more than 99% and my followers have doubled in two months!</p>

<p>I can’t wait for the first TBA Retreats meetup and I really can’t wait to see how everyone has progressed with their goals!! You can read more about my experience at the retreat or other IOC retreats as well!</p>

<p>So not everybody needs a blogging retreat to kick it in gear and become the blogger they always wanted to be, but I would say if you get the chance, DO IT. Because not only will you become a better blogger, but you will also become part of a community that rocks. Institute of Code worked very hard to partner with the best in the industry not only at sharing tips to do with blogging but inspiring us all, and encouraging us to have tons of fun. Huge thanks to IOC for that, and the BlondeAbroad and everyone here in Bali that helped make the best retreat ever. I can’t wait to see what’s next for them, and for all the girls I got to meet along the way.</p>
