    <article class="entry-post">
      <p>Do you ever wonder how I travel to amazing places and make spectacular adventures without coming back to the states to work? That is the biggest question I get from almost everyone. They wonder what I do for money, how I do it and how I get to travel all the time while doing it. This post is meant to teach you all my secrets!<br /><br />First things first, I do not travel the world for free and I do not travel without working. Surprise! I work full time online while also traveling full time (which is a full-time job). So, you could say that I am a busy woman. But, I am living the life of my dreams! And you can too.<br /><br />I started working online less than a year ago. Before that I was just traveling full time and running out of money. You may have heard my story before of how I got started working but let me share it again.<br /><br />After 2 years of full time travel I ran out of money. I spent my last dollars on a blogging course in Bali with the Blonde Abroad and that was it. Unfortunately, shortly after the retreat began, I realized that I wasn’t going to start making money immediately on my blog just because I spent two weeks working with an awesome blogger.  Which then made me realize that my only options were to look for some kind of job abroad or fly home. Then I remembered I didn’t have any money to book a ticket home so, I was stranded in Bali with nowhere to live, no job and obviously, no money.<br /><br />That’s when things were truly bad, but also actually good. I was swimming at the pool with some friends when I confided in them that I had no money and nowhere to live. My new bestie Esther offered to let me live with her while she did a pet sitting gig in Denpasar.  This meant free accommodation just for helping her take care of two street puppies while I figured out what to do with my life. I was all over it!<br /><br />As soon as we moved in together I began to learn SO MUCH from Esther. This amazing woman runs 2 successful businesses online and eventually she started offering me small jobs here and there, like newsletters and blog writing for her.<br /><br />One of her businesses is called the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">Virtual Assistant Internship</a>. She hired me to update the site and fix a broken plugin because she just didn’t have the time and she knew that I would do a great job. After going through the content in the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">90 Day VA course</a>, I started to apply the things I was learning to my own blog. I shared with Esther about the traffic I started getting towards my blog and how her course really made all the difference. Next thing I knew, she offered me a job managing her membership site.<br /><br />And this is where it all began for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen"><img src="/uploads/make-all-your-travel-dreams-come-true.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I now run two membership sites and manage several other online businesses. I have also grown my own blog and continue to help others grow theirs as well. My favorite job that I do though, is helping people grow their Pinterest accounts. That’s right, I get paid to pin! I recently helped a client go from 0 to 46k views in just 3 weeks!<br /><br />Recently I went over my taxes (since it’s that time of year), and once I had everything organized, I realized that last year my life totals came to -$9,000. That’s right, NEGATIVE 9K! This year, and its only April, I have paid off all my debt, put money in savings and will be buying a new computer to further my business!</p>

<p><br />How did I get to this point? Well that’s what I want to share with you all. I want you to know how attainable my life actually is for anyone. It’s nothing crazy, I am not special, I just worked hard and I bridged the gap between the skills I have and the jobs that are out there. I can’t wait to see where this year takes me and I owe a lot of my success to the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">Virtual Assistant Internship.</a><br /><br />It’s official, I am living my best life.<br /><br />My acceleration really happened with Esther’s <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">90 Day VA course</a>. And now, she is coming out with a new course taking you from skills to invoicing your first customer! The best part about this is that I get to be a part of it. I get to help create the worksheets and grow her brand and business. With Esther, you can skip all the craziness and go straight from skills to clients. And quite honestly, a lot of girls get their clients before the course even ends. This <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen"> 90 Day VA course</a> is life changing.<br /><br /><br />There you have it. My secret to success in writing. Working FULL TIME online, while traveling FULL TIME and completely loving my life. Now this doesn’t just have to be for all you travel girls out there either. <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">The 90 Day VA course</a> is for anyone who wants to take their life into their own hands and manage their own time. Work from home or remote. Whatever your desires might be, <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">Esther’s course</a> will take you there.</p>
