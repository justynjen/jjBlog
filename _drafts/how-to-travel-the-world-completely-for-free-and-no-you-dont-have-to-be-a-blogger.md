Everyone wants to travel more, I think that’s a given. (At least everyone I know is trying to travel more...)

What if I told you that there was a no bullshit way to actually travel the world for free. And no. You don’t have to have a blog or be instafamous to do this. What I am going to tell you today is totally going to change the way you vacation. Hopefully it helps you make the most out of your precious vacation days as well.

Introducing [Trusted House Sitters.](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/su/BdGwqFEz){: target="_blank"} [Trusted House Sitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/su/BdGwqFEz){: target="_blank"} is an incredible platform that connects you with people all around the world who need someone to watch their house or pets while they take a vacation.

##### How does it work?

You can sign up for Trusted House Sitters [HERE.](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/su/BdGwqFEz){: target="_blank"} (Yes it costs $120 a year, but the number of times I get free accommodation around the world saves me hundreds) Once you sign up you can search for house sits anywhere in the world and apply to an unlimited number of sits. You can search by location, duration, type and number of pets, family friendly and more. I’ve seen house sits in New York, Vancouver, Dubai, Panama (for 3 months!) and all over Europe and Australia.

Next time you have some vacation time and want to check out a unique new location, just hop onto Trusted House Sitters. With all the money you save on accommodation, you can afford to go on several more vacations a year.

Trusted House Sitters is also great for doing stay-cations. I’ve done them around the UK and America just for the weekend, sometimes just an hour away from where I am living. It’s always great to get away for the weekend and this helps you do it for free.

On the Trusted House Sitters website you can find all sorts of tips like, how to write the perfect cover letter for your first house sit and how to prepare for your first house sit. (They also have tons of information for those that are looking to find house sitters! A great option if you don’t want to board your pets while you are away.)

**So that’s how to get free accommodation but now how do we get there?**

I often get a lot of questions from people about *how to find cheap flights.* There are a lot of tips to getting a great deal but honestly what I recommend is to start saving up points and use those towards your flights.

Not all travel credit cards are created equal and I am by no means the travel credit card expert. If you want the expert you NEED to check out the pointsguy.com because he is killing it. I just want to let you know what card I recommend. I have a couple travel cards but my absolute favorite right now is the [Chase Sapphire Preferred Card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/UUQPE6XUYI){: target="_blank"}. They have a 50,000 point sign on bonus and honestly amazing benefits for all of their card members. The Sapphire Card isn’t quite as nice as the Reserve but the Reserve has a $500 annual fee that I just have not been able to get on board with yet. (lol)

How to maximise your credit card spending to get you LOTS of points for travel but no debt.. It’s actually quite simple. (Please don’t get a credit card if you can’t manage your money, like always, be smart and do what’s right for you)

Sign up for your new travel credit card when you know that you have a lot of spending coming up. For me, this is when I know that I have to pay a large bill or book something. Pay for it on your credit card and you will easily meet your signup bonus requirements.
