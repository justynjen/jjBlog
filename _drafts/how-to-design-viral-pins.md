For me, Pinterest is a major source of blog traffic. When you use Pinterest as a Search Engine, instead of a social media platform you can really explode your traffic. In order to really succeed on Pinterest though, you're pins have to stand out from the rest. You need to design viral pins that stand out from the millions of pins that get uploaded to the platform everyday.&nbsp;

The Pinterest Smart feed can tell when pins are designed well and how they perform. Having beautiful images is really important but is it enough? There's actually a real science behind creating the perfect pin that will lead to repins and go viral generating tons of clicks back to your website.&nbsp;

In this guide I am going to teach you everything you need to know about creating the perfect viral pin; what you need to include in your pin, what Pinterest recommends for you and and what works vs what doesn't.&nbsp;

Are you ready to create Viral Pins?
