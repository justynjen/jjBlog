I think at this point it's pretty obvious that Travel Con was a huge success. I personally had an incredible time meeting the variety of bloggers and speakers, attendees and volunteers. It's something I was on the fence of attending just because of other travel plans, however, I am so glad that I decided to go. I wanted to share with you what my biggest take away's were and why [you should attend next year](https://travelcon.org/){: target="_blank"}. Here's my 51 favorite take away's from [Travel Con!&nbsp;](https://travelcon.org/){: target="_blank"}

1. If it's hard, it just means you're doing what your supposed to be doing. It's not supposed to be easy. Our first keynote speaker talked about how an author once said, writing was like waking up every morning and eating glass, but you continue to do it anyway. I thought that was absolutely crazy but at the same time, kind of amazing.

2. Do the work that only you can do. This struck me so hard on the first day. I have never felt like I was doing work that only I could do. I think this was partly because I was still on the fence and unsure of my voice. I have since decided to throw all doubt out the window and take off.&nbsp;

3. Networking is key to success! I have never networked before travelcon. Most of the time, I don't even tell people what I do... (I know, very stupid) but travelcon taught me that people want to hear my story and connect with me. I even met amazing bloggers willing to host me in their cities. (My first stop is to visit Chauntel from [Voyaging Vagabond](https://voyagingvagabond.com/){: target="_blank"} to apple pick in Rhode Island)

4. Be honest with yourself and with brands. Being honest is going to be your fastest way to success. Don't promise a brand results you can't deliver and don't set goals with yourself that you also can't deliver. Just be honest with your expectations of yourself and with others.&nbsp;

5. Under promise and over deliver. This is something I learned from freelancing as well. Always under promise and over deliver. This way when you give results, they are even better than what you originally said they'd be and people will be way more excited to work with you in the future.&nbsp;

6. FIND YOUR VOICE and be true to that voice. Okay guys, I have struggled with this since day one. I have never been true to my voice mostly because I wasn't even sure yet what my voice was. I didn't know who I was as a person, let alone a blogger and I was constantly trying to mold myself to 'fit in'. Get ready because that's about to change. I am officially me and I hope you are as excited as I am to get to know me ;).

7. Get on the passive income train. I have very few streams of passive income and that is not smart. I love Nomadic Matt's brand because he is thriving from a few wonderful sources of passive income, from courses to eBooks, he has it all. I hope you are ready to see a few more products come your way from my blog as well because I have a few things in the works!&nbsp;

8. Utilize your email list and be working to always be growing that list. I talked with a lot of bloggers that had never sent an email to their list or who weren't even trying to build that list. I know my list isn't huge, but it's something that I put a lot of thought into. Always remember that you own the audience on that list and it's a great way to make money as well.&nbsp;

9. You don't own your social media audience. You own your blog and email list. Don't put all your eggs in one basket on social media because when that platform dies, like we all know it will, you will no longer have an audience. Convert your current following to your blog and email list. For great tips on how you can do this, check out one of my favorite girl bosses, Jenna Kutcher.&nbsp;

10. It's okay to ask for help. In fact, you should almost always be asking for help. I don't know about you but I definitely can't do everything and I don't even want to try. Ask for help from those around you. Hire help, do a trade, whatever you have to do! But don't be afraid to ask.&nbsp;

11. It's okay to go offline. I think every blogger that spoke talked about how they needed a break from social media, so they went offline and their audience didn't disappear, the world didn't end, and when they resumed posting, most people admired them for knowing when to step away.

12. It's okay to fail. In fact, you are going to fail
