You've all heard them. The whispers in the social media blogosphere outlining theories to gain Pinterest followers fast or tips to increase engagement today. I know you've heard them because I've shared A LOT of them on my own blog here.

Today I am talking about Pinterest myths.

Blogs have been taking off with a variety of tips to grow your Pinterest. Next thing you know dedicated Pinners are deleting Pins right before their prime and filling queues with hundreds of daily Pins. Or worse, they are not even giving Pinterest a fair shot as a marketing tool.

So today I want to set the record straight! Because you know I LOVE Pinterest as my number 1 marketing tool.&nbsp;

##### You should be manually pinning or pinning in real time is better than manual pinning.

Pinterest is looking for consistency and timing. When you use a scheduler, it's SO much easier to post more often and in the correct time zone for your audience. This is a big for me, since I travel so much and am always in different time zones, but my audience pretty much stays in the same time zone.&nbsp;

If you are attempting to consistently hit your target time zone on Pinterest but you aren't using a scheduler, you'll be facing a lot of hurdles.&nbsp;

##### Pinterest is only for middle aged women!

I might have said 10 years ago that Pinterest was overrun with middle aged women pinning cat memes but the tables have turned!&nbsp;

With over 100 million active pinners, millennials are growing on the platform as well as men! Yes MEN are on Pinterest. More men join everyday then women so believe me, whatever your niche is, you can find your market on Pinterest.&nbsp;

##### Hashtags work the same on Pinterest as they do on Instagram and Twitter

I've talked a lot about hashtags while creating my Pinterest Course. I have learned that Hashtags are NOT used the same way on Pinterest as they are on Instagram and Twitter.&nbsp;

For Hashtags to work on Pinterest you have to include the '#' in your search. Hashtags also only work on&nbsp;**new pins.**&nbsp;What do I mean by this? This means that hashtags only work when the pin is first put on Pinterest. After that, your pin won't show up in search results.&nbsp;

Here's what Pinterest has to say about it:&nbsp;

*“Hashtags are a new way to reach users interested in your content. When a user searches a hashtag the freshest pins with that hashtag will appear at the top of the feed. When a user searches the same phrase without the hashtag, it will pull up the original search results page.”*

##### If you are using a scheduler you should be pinning 300+ times a day

I am just going to tell you this upfront. Repins fall flat at anything above 50 pins a day. Save yourself the time, energy and sanity by keeping your pinning to 50 pins or less a day.&nbsp;

Tailwind is working on a full analysis of this myth but when they know more I will update this. For now, keep your pinning to 50 times a day max.&nbsp;

##### Pinterest is punishing group boards

Pinterest isn't punishing group boards. When Pinterest first started Group Boards were the ultimate gold mine, and a lot of times they still are. The biggest difference with Pinterest now and Pinterest when it started is the SmartFeed.&nbsp;

It's time for you to create a new strategy. It's time to pin content that is engaging, aligned with group boards and rules and consistent. That's how you are going to see success on Group Boards and on Pinterest in general.&nbsp;

##### You should be solely focused on followers like you probably are on Instagram

Pinterest works better with your personal goals. If your goal is simply to have more followers, then keep focusing on that. However, if your goal is to market your blog, then you want clicks and engagement. If you want brand awareness then you want views. Followers don't matter at the end of the day. What matters is that you are getting the clicks and impressions that align with your goals.&nbsp;

##### Delete pins without engagement. You must delete pins that aren’t getting engagement.

First things first, DON'T DELETE PINS WITH NO ENGAGEMENT. JUST DON'T.&nbsp;

Alright I'm done yelling. I just had to get that off my chest first. Pins take time. Tailwind did a study that showed a pin took 32 weeks to become Viral. 32 WEEKS. That's a long time. And if you had deleted that pin before that, it would have never gone viral. Give your pins the chance to go viral. Don't delete them just because they didn't instantly bring all the traffic to your yard.&nbsp;

Alright so these are, in my opinion, the biggest Pinterest Myths. Now debunked.
