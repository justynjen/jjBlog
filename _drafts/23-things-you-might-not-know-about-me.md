I'm turning 23 this week so I thought I would write a fun post for all of my new followers with **23 things that you might not know about me!&nbsp;**

1. My name is pronounced just(in)

2. I'm the middle child of 3.&nbsp;

3. I have been traveling full time almost 3,5 years now and time has FLOWN by

4. Last year while living in Bali I completely ran out of money, maxed out my credit card and taught myself how to work online so I didn't have to come home

5. I have visited over 50 countries, all before turning 23. I hope to visit several more before turning 24!

6. I am from Utah, but I did spend part of my childhood in Texas!

7. I am a HUGE book nerd and used to read under the covers with a flashlight at night. (My mom even got in trouble with my school when I was little because they thought she was letting me read too mature of books i.e. Eragon when I was in the 4th grade)

8. I've been skydiving and paragliding but I am WAY too scared to bungee jump

9. I am very passionate about art. I used to draw all the time when I was younger and I dreamt of being a tattooist.&nbsp;

10. My second toe is my longest toe and growing up my dad tormented me by calling me long toe (because apparently this is unnatural) - to the point where I refused to wear sandals until very recently&nbsp;

11. The first foreign country I ever went to was Russia. And I was terrified. I haven't been back but would actually love to visit a few friends I have that live there.

12. I got a tattoo in a skate park/bar in Bali. And yes it's of a band-aid. (I want to get dinosaurs üê±‚Äçüêâ tattooed on it so people stop thinking it's a skateboard)

13. My favorite place in the world is Japan because their toilets are incredible

14. I have mushrooms üçÑ tattooed on the back of my calf and I tell everyone it's because I like to take trips (pun intended üòÇ)

15. When I left home I couldn't read a map. My first year abroad I spent more time lost than anything else

16. I work online as a Pinterest Marketer WHICH is how I fund my travels. I am not a sugar baby but I sure wish I was. The most money my parents have given me to travel was $100 back when I ran out of money in Bali.

17. My dream vacation is anywhere with a private white sand beach which is why I am celebrating 23 in the Seychelles!

18. I've been politely asked to leave Europe for accidentally over staying my Schengen Visa. (They were very understanding because apparently it happens a lot)

19. Before embarking on this dream chasing adventure I worked as a Care Assistant in Nursing Homes and Hospice for over 4 years and my dream was to be a nurse. (It was my parents who encouraged me to put school on hold)

20. I hate wearing shoes inside. I will always slip my shoes off when I go inside someones house even when they stop me to tell me I don't have too. I can't wear shoes indoors.

21. I once called my dad just to have someone to talk to while I tried to wash a spider down the drain, which took me over half an hour and an entire bottle of hairspray. (When I went to Australia I used to check my whole room for the creepy buggers every night before sleeping) Also I probably won't sleep tonight because now I'm thinking about them.

22. I love doing laundry - especially folding laundry.

23. Almost every time I fly I imagine the plane blowing up like in Final Destination yet my favorite thing to do is fly... ‚úà
