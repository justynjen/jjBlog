I think that we can all agree that there is way to much plastic in our world. I personally have been to way too many beaches and hiking trails covered in trash, so I have made it my mission to find little ways to stop using plastic everyday. Some of these may seem obvious, but I hope they help make you a little more conscious of the plastic that you contribute to this planet we share.&nbsp;

#### first, the stats

* It is now believed that there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in the ocean. Of that mass, 269,000 tons float on the surface, while some four billion plastic microfibers per square kilometer litter the deep sea. - [The Ocean Crusaders](http://oceancrusaders.org/plastic-crusades/plastic-statistics/){: target="_blank"}
* 91% of plastic waste isn’t recycled. And since most plastics don’t biodegrade in any meaningful sense, all that plastic waste could exist for hundreds or even thousands of years. - [Earth Day](https://www.earthday.org/2018/03/07/fact-sheet-end-plastic-pollution/){: target="_blank"}
* 500 MILLION plastic straws are used EVERY DAY in America.&nbsp;*That’s enough to circle the Earth twice. -*[The National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/csp/greenline_straw_free){: target="_blank"}
* There is more microplastic in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way. - [The UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/02/552052-turn-tide-plastic-urges-un-microplastics-seas-now-outnumber-stars-our-galaxy#.WLA81BLyvBJ){: target="_blank"}

Now that I have you attention, I am hoping the following tips will encourage you to start making small changes in your everyday life!&nbsp;

#### 1. Say NO to plastic straws.

Buy one and keep it in your purse or backpack. Or switch to paper straws. One of my favorite things from this year has to do with a coffee shop I loved switching to paper straws. Everyday we went to this coffee shop in London and got an iced coffee with no straw. They knew our orders, we loved the cafe but they used so many plastic straws. Then one day I went in and the staff was beyond excited to share with me that they had switched to paper straws so that I could use them! Start saying no to plastic straws and maybe you can see these changes in your own community.&nbsp;

#### 2. don't bag all your fruits and veggies at the grocery store

I know people might look at you funny, but just put them in your cart. You wash them when you get home anyway! It's an unnecessary use of plastic to bag all those fruits and veggies.&nbsp;

#### 3. get reusable bags for your grocery shopping

This is honestly one of the easiest ways to use less plastic. And most grocery stores will even sell you bags that you can reuse. Or buy some on Amazon. Whatever works for you but this is an easy one for less plastic use.&nbsp;

#### 4. Bamboo Toothbrush

Switch over to a bamboo toothbrush! I love mine, I actually got it at travel con!&nbsp;

#### 5. Get a reusable mug/water bottle

Don't use those plastic water bottles! There's no need. Carry with you a reusable bottle and you can even take your own mug to a coffee shop and use that.&nbsp;

You can find my favorite mug here and my favorite water bottle here!

#### 6. reusable food wrap

This will also help you save money because you won't always be buying more food wrap. 2 birds, 1 stone. You can find the best reusable food wrap here.

#### 7. also a reusable toiletry bag

#### 8. and add in a shampoo and conditioner bar instead of liquid&nbsp;

#### 9. a deva cup

#### 10. ride your bike, walk or take the bus

#### 11. support local brands instead of corporations

#### 12. fabulous cotton buds that are great for the environment&nbsp;

#### 13. use glass bottles for milk

#### 14. put things in Tupperware instead of plastic bags

#### 15. Sign up for the plastic campaign to get updates and stay reminded and in the 'know'
