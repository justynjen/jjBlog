With 2019 looming literally right around the corner I have been thinking A LOT about where I want to take my business and myself this year. My bucket list is always growing but this year I really want to focus on my business as much as my travel. That's why I've decided to focus my travels on growth as well as adventure. By posting my goals here I am hoping that you can help hold me accountable!&nbsp;

My first goal of 2019 is to start a Mentorship program. Over the past 2 years I have seen so much growth in myself and my life. I want to share that growth with others, especially those less fortunate than me. That's why I am going to be mentoring girls who want to make money and work online so that they can see success in their personal lives and make their dreams come true. There are so many online courses, I mean, I've even created my own. But I also understand that not everyone can afford to pay for my course. That's why I want to offer this mentorship TOTALLY free to those who need it.&nbsp;
