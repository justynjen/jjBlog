I recently began taking a plant-based approach to life. I haven't eaten meat for some time now and dropping dairy was the next step. Being Plant Based has challenged me to find new and exciting places to eat in the cities that I travel in, while still being able to try to the local cuisine. Now of course, the local cuisine here in Austin is BBQ and every joint I tried to eat at was all meat, meat, meat. Not being able to try the BBQ forced me to think outside the box. What other foodie destinations does Austin provide?&nbsp;

Are you ready? I am going to share with you all my Austin eats. Austin had such a diverse food landscape, with tasty bites from around the world including about 100 different food trucks!&nbsp;

#### torchy's tacos!

My favorite tacos in Austin were from Torchy's Tacos! I had their fried avocado tacos with their guac and chips. For Vegans, just make sure you ask for them without dairy (They come with cheese)

Torchy's was amazing, fresh food and they also had really great staff! It was easy to order and the food came out very quickly.&nbsp;
