Travel Con gave me a ton of homework, starting with reading. I bought one book there but left with a list miles long of new reads. Since I am such an avid reader, I wanted to share my list with you so you can find some great books as well.&nbsp;

1. Vagabonding

2. Year of Living Danishly

3. Bird by Bird

4. On the Road

5. A Thousand new Beginnings&nbsp;

6.&nbsp;
