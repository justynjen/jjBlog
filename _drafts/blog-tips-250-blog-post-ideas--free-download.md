Keeping a list of blog post ideas helps you fight writer's block and stay in the blogging groove. We all know that the worst thing that can happen to bloggers is writers block. Staying creative and motivated is one of the hardest things about blogging. Some weeks I just can't think of anything helpful to write about.

That's why over the past week I have decided to [create a list of ALL the things](https://www.subscribepage.com/blog-post-ideas){: target="_blank"} I could write about for my blog. Then I decided to make a list of all the thing you could write about, no matter what your niche is! I'm sharing that list with you today so that next time you can't think of what to write about, just head over to the master list and pick something out.&nbsp;

[If you still don't have a niche for you blog you can pick one from this huge list I put together for you!&nbsp;](https://www.subscribepage.com/100-blog-niches){: target="_blank"}

When you are choosing a blog topic, it's important to ask yourself a few questions.&nbsp;

1. Does this blog post solve a problem? If so, what problem is it solving?
2. Why do you want to write this post?
3. What keywords can you use for this post?
4. Does this post help your specific audience?
5. Can you give away a free download with this post to grab emails from this post?&nbsp;

Coming up with blog post ideas and then making sure that you can answer all of these questions about that blog post can be extremely stressful. You need to make sure that you stay creative in your business. When you go to make your own list of blog posts that you can write, think of what you are passionate about. What made you start your blog? Can you blog about that? What are you good at?

When I really can't come up with a blog post idea I start doing research on Pinterest. On Pinterest you can see what's popular. What are people in your niche writing about? There's no need to always be reinventing the wheel. I always remind people that you are the expert to your audience. Just because you follow 100 garden blogs, doesn't mean that the people that follow you also follow 100 other garden blogs. They probably only follow you! This means that you can find what's working for other people and make it work for you. (P.S. I am not saying that you can copy people. That's never okay. I just mean find what works for them and do it your way.)
