Bern is one of the most quintessential Swiss towns that you could visit. It's the capital of Switzerland, which you might have already known but I found that to be a bit surprising just because Zurich and Geneva were much more well known to me. &nbsp;However, spending New Year's in Bern that made this cute Swiss city to grow on me.&nbsp;

Before I share all the secrets for how to make the most out of a New Year in Bern, let me share with you a few things that you might not have known about Bern.&nbsp;

* Bern is the 4th largest city in Switzerland with 130,000 people living there.&nbsp;
* The street signs in the Old Town are different colors – green, white, yellow and burgundy. This is a hangover from when Napoleon conquered the city in 1798. His troops were largely illiterate so the colored signs were used to help them find their quarters.&nbsp;
* Bern’s two gifts to the sweet-toothed world are [Toblerone](https://amzn.to/2D7Gb4I){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and Ovomaltine.
* German is the main language (81% of the population) followed by Italian (3.9%) and French (3.6%).
* All of the Old Town is a Unesco heritage site, making tourism big business.
