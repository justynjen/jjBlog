Do you ever hit publish on a new blog post and then sit there and watch as no one views it? Well first things first, don't sit and watch! I am a true believer that the watched pot never boils. Instead of watching and waiting for traffic to come in, take some actionable steps to make traffic come your way using different social sharing sites and tricks that I am going to share with you today.&nbsp;

An unread blog does nothing for you, and it doesn't reach and help the audience that you are trying to reach. The first thing that you should be doing for every blog post that you write is proper keyword research.&nbsp;

#### 1. Keyword Research

I have taught new bloggers how to do keyword research in two ways. One way being through Google and the other being through Pinterest. If you want to learn more about keyword research through Pinterest, check out my Ultimate Guide to Pinterest today. I'll be creating a guide to Keyword Research on Google one day too.

##### What are keywords?

Keywords are what a user is searching for when they head over to google to look something up. Think of yourself as the user. Say you are taking a trip to Paris. You'll want to make sure that you check out the locals favorite cafes while you are there. To find out what those are you need to head over to Google or Pinterest and search, **Local Cafe Favorites in Paris.&nbsp;**This is what we call a long-tail keywords. These long-tail keywords are what you want to include in your blog posts. Then, when people search for a topic that you have written about, your blog post will come up because of that keyword! Wallah! That's how Google and Pinterest work.

If you don't use Keywords in your blog posts, no one is going to find them through Google and if no one is finding your blog posts organically, then that's a bad thing. (Organic means through a search. Paid ads for Google don't count as organic leads from Google.)

#### 2. Blog Titles&nbsp;

After you know what keywords you are going to use, you need to give it an eye catching title. You have only about 5 seconds to grab the attention of your readers. This is why your title is so important. &nbsp;When it comes to picking the title of your post, you should NEVER just pick one title and roll with it. The best practice for creating the best post title is to write out at least 20 title options for each post that you want to write. This is something that you will get faster at so don't panic. I know writing 20 titles can sound overwhelming but when people search on Google, your title is going to be the first thing they see and if that title doesn't stand out to them they are never going to click into your post.&nbsp;

The two tools I use AFTER I have written out my 20 titles are:&nbsp;

* [Capitalize my Title&nbsp;](capitalizemytitle.com){: target="_blank"}
* [The Headline Analyzer from CoSchedule](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer){: target="_blank"}

Capitalize my title is amazing because you just put your title in there and it tells you what should be capitalized and what shouldn't!&nbsp;

The Headline Analyzer is probably the best thing ever invented for bloggers. It tells you how powerful your title is. After I write my 20 titles, I then pick the top 5 and plug them into that analyzer to see what's the strongest.&nbsp;

#### 3. Social Media

Next up is social media. Using Social Media to share your blog after it's posted is a great way to let people know it's out there. You want to get lots of hits to your website from social media because that helps programs like Google see how valuable your site it. When you are sharing to social media you should create some social images for sharing.

The places that you can share your blog post are:&nbsp;

* Instagram Post
* Instagram Stories&nbsp;
* Your Facebook Page
* Various Facebook Groups
* Your Facebook Stories
* StumbleUpon
* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Twitter

I recommend that you create different graphics for each social media share. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/){: target="_blank"} is a great place to create those graphics. For Instagram and Facebook Stories you are going to want to create long images with lots of info. For the Facebook Shares you want the long rectangle images and then for Instagram you want to use square graphics. (Those are just a few options but there are lots graphics that you could create)

Once the post is uploaded, create those graphics and share them with the link everywhere that you usually post.

#### 4. Facebook Groups

Facebook Groups are an awesome way that you can share you blog to an even larger audience. I recommend joining at least 5 different Facebook Groups that allow you to share your posts. Usually these groups will allow you to share your posts a certain day a week so mark your calendar and make sure that you are sharing that day! They also let you do social media posting on certain days so that can be a great way to get tons of new engagement!&nbsp;

When you are sharing in Facebook Groups, make sure that you always engage with other's articles. A lot of people ask that you leave an engaging comment so just always set aside some time in the day to participate.&nbsp;

#### 5. Pinterest!&nbsp;

Of course you had to know that I would talk about Pinterest. I have a ton of resources for Pinterest and how to use it to best grow your blog and get more traffic so be sure that you check those out but in the meantime, the best way that you can start to get more traffic to your blog is by creating pin images to share for Pinterest. I recommend that every for every blog post you create 5-7 pins, put 1 or 2 of those pins on your website and then share the rest onto Pinterest. Always use keyword rich descriptions if you want to get a lot of traffic from that pin back to your blog. Once you have shared to Pinterest make sure that you schedule it to repost often so that you content never goes dry. You can do this using Tailwind's new looping feature.&nbsp;

I teach you all about Pinterest and Tailwinds in my brand new [Pinterest Course](https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook-course/){: target="_blank"}[: The Pinterest Playbook](https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook-course/){: target="_blank"}, which you can enroll in&nbsp;[right here!](https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook-course/){: target="_blank"}

If you follow these steps you are going to get so much more traffic to your blog with every post you share, I can guarantee that. Thanks for reading along my 5 tips for driving more traffic to your blog, I hope you found these tips helpful.

See you in the course and in the meantime happy blogging!&nbsp;
