Blogging is hard. Travel is hard. Blogging while traveling while also freelancing to make money for it all is damn hard. I have been traveling for over 3 years. Rocking this location independent lifestyle and trotting the globe. However, in 3 years, I have made about $300 from my blog. That's right, a justyn jen income report of around $300 in 3 years. That's pretty awful right? Do you want to know why I only made $300 in 3 years of blogging and yet why I am still trying? Read on...

#### why i didn't quit

You might be asking yourself, if it takes that much time and energy and I am literally getting no return, why haven't I quit? I haven't yet quit because I love writing and sharing my story. However, it gets so hard when you see SO MANY bloggers out there (mainly on Pinterest) talking about how they made $25,000 in just this year of blogging alone. Let me be the first to tell you that I hate these people. They make me want to quit.&nbsp;

\*\* Okay so hate is a little harsh but it's really discouraging when people are all talk and no action. Everyone can share their magical income report of how their blog killed it, but you don't see the big timers doing that and why is that do you think? Stop using this as click bait! Thanks bye rant over.

#### what to do when you want to quit

Remind yourself of why you got into this in the first place. Do you want to share a special message? Do you want to make a change? Or just share you story? If you are just in this for the money then you probably should quit.&nbsp;

When I feel like quitting I look back at all the adventures that I have been on and more importantly, I think about all the people that I have met. There have been so many times where I met people who told me how much I inspired them or encouraged them to travel more, quit their job, or just pursue something that they loved. That's why I do this.&nbsp;

I also call my dad whenever I feel like quitting because he always talks me out of every pity party I throw myself. So next time you are feeling discouraged, call you dad. (or whoever that is for you)
