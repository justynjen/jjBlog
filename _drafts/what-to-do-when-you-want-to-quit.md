Blogging is hard. Travel is hard. Blogging while traveling while also freelancing to make money for it all is damn hard. I have been traveling for over 3 years. Rocking this location independent lifestyle and trotting the globe. However, in 3 years, I have made about $300 from my blog. That's right, a justyn jen income report of around $300 in 3 years. That's pretty awful right? Do you want to know why I only made $300 in 3 years of blogging and yet why I am still trying? Read on…

#### why i didn't quit

You might be asking yourself, if it takes that much time and energy and I am literally getting no return, why haven't I quit? I haven't yet quit because I love writing and sharing my story. However, it gets so hard when you see SO MANY bloggers out there (mainly on Pinterest) talking about how they made $25,000 in just this year of blogging alone. Let me be the first to tell you that I do not love these people. They make me want to quit. Who else feels this way?

#### what to do when you want to quit

Remind yourself of why you got into this in the first place. Do you want to share a special message? Do you want to make a change? Or just share you story? If you are just in this for the money then you probably should quit. 

When I feel like quitting I look back at all the adventures that I have been on and more importantly, I think about all the people that I have met. There have been so many times where I met people who told me how much I inspired them or encouraged them to travel more, quit their job, or just pursue something that they loved. That's why I do this. 

I also call my dad whenever I feel like quitting because he always talks me out of every pity party I throw myself. So next time you are feeling discouraged, call you dad. (or whoever that is for you)

#### identify why you want to quit

Make a list of reasons why you are feeling this way. I will go through mine with you right now.

1. I got fired or let go by a client (this is always the hardest one for me. It always makes me feel like I didn't try hard enough or put in the right amount of effort)

2. When someone tells me that I suck (maybe not suck but I do get people telling me discouraging things and not supporting me)

3. When I see other people doing it better than me (which is always! Obviously I haven't been doing overly well if I have only monetized my blog to make $300 in 3 years guys)

Now that you have identified common reasons why you want to quit, try to avoid those things in your life. If people are always bringing you down, then you need to cut those people out of your life. If strangers are bringing you down with their success, then you need to take a break from social media. Have some you time.

#### 15 ways to help yourself not quit

1. Meditate
2. Do you self affirmations
3. Listen to an inspiring podcast
4. Phone a friend
5. Turn off your phone or computer
6. Take a walk
7. Cook yourself a nice dinner
8. Read a book
9. Go to the beach, mountains, park or where ever you feel most at peace
10. Just watch a movie
11. Exercise
12. Make time with friends
13. Go out for drinks
14. Journal, Scrapbook or look at old photos
15. Ask for help

Blogging isn't easy, but if you are anything like me, you aren't going to quit. I hope that this has helped you to remember why you started all this. Why you got into blogging or your own business or travel or anything! And if you need a buddy, drop me your email in the sidebar and I can help! It's always easier when you have someone to talk to.
