1. Book a hostel - I recommend these 2. (But get a private room)
2. Organize a taxi pickup with your hostel. 
3. Find a buddy to visit slums with.
4. Wear really appropriate clothing - pants and long sleeves and long dresses
5. Book tours at the hotel
6. Get a driver for going to the pyramids
7. Get your visa at the airport bank
8. Order food at the hostel for delivery 
9. Don't go to the Pyramids alone - grab a buddy! 
10. Ride in the taxi cabs - but also negotiate prices first
11. Travel in the women's only car of the subway
12. Don't go out to clubs or bars
13. Visit New Cairo for a breath of fresh air
14. Be polite to people in the street - but don't go inside Bazaars with people. Politely decline. 
15. Get a Sim Card at the airport - mine was 30 gigs for only $6
16. Take the train to Luxor and stay for a few nights
17. Grab yourself some Nescafe - you'll need it
18. Avoid the nonalcoholic beer. It's nasty yo
19. Get cash out of the ATM. I never paid with card
20. Head to the museums later in the day. Kids are there for school trips and they will want 100 pictures and they will follow you around the whole time.
