Alright guys, I am writing this post for 2 reasons.&nbsp;

#1 I want to help other bloggers know how they can monetize their blogs

#2 I want my friends and family to understand that I do actually make money on this blog, regardless of what's discussed at Thanksgiving.&nbsp;

This isn't an income report, and this isn't one of those, Learn how I made X amount in just 1 month blogging. This post is just what I have learned over the past 3 years of this blog making very little money and how I have changed that.&nbsp;
