Alright guys, I am writing this post for 2 reasons.&nbsp;

#1 I want to help other bloggers know how they can monetize their blogs

#2 I want my friends and family to understand that I do actually make money on this blog, regardless of what's discussed at Thanksgiving.&nbsp;

This isn't an income report, and this isn't one of those, Learn how I made X amount in just 1 month blogging. This post is just what I have learned over the past 3 years of this blog making very little money and how I have changed that.&nbsp;

In my Ultimate Guide to Starting a Profitable Blog I talk briefly about the different ways that you can make money blogging but in this post I want to explore those a lot more.&nbsp;

There are 4 main ways that bloggers can make money these days online.&nbsp;

#### Ads

Ads are the most traditional way that people have made money on their websites since the beginning of time. However, it's an outdated method. Ads are busy and distracting. They can also make your website slow and clunky. Not to mention most everyone I know, uses an ad blocker on their browser. (I use Adblock) This means they aren't even going to see your ads, let alone click on them.&nbsp;

Another way people make money blogging (and this is one method that I use) is,&nbsp;

#### Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing can be extremely powerful, when it's done right. But first, what is affiliate marketing? It means that you are going to market a product for someone else, but you need to do it with a special tracking link that allows the company to know what customers are traffic from you. You get paid a portion of what the company makes, at no additional cost to your audience because you are marketing for that company.&nbsp;

My main tips for affiliate marketing are:&nbsp;

* Only promote products that you actually like and use. If you promote something that sucks, your audience is going to stop trusting you really fast.
* Join lots of affiliate programs! Chances are, all the stores you already love have an affiliate program so make sure you've signed up.&nbsp;
* Write informative blog posts educating your readers about the product instead of just throwing links up and hoping people will come.&nbsp;
* Always make sure that you read through the affiliate guidelines so you understand how you are allowed to use your links. Almost every program is different!&nbsp;
* Some programs will kick you out if you don't make a certain about of money is a specific amount of time so don't join those programs until you are seeing more traffic from your blog.
* Disclose your affiliate links so users are aware they will be buying through them - even though it doesn't cost them anything.&nbsp;
* [And lastly, grab my free download all about affiliate programs that you can join](https://www.subscribepage.com/affiliate-bloggers){: target="_blank"} (I include over 40 that I am a part of for different products and services!)

Affiliate marketing can be an easy way to make money blogging but you need to keep in mind that you aren't going to make a lot at first. To succeed with affiliate marketing you need traffic and loyal fans who love what you promote. This is why I suggest writing blog posts instead of just throwing links up. (I personally have both those since I do have my resources page!)

#### Collaborations

I have found myself explaining my collaborations more and more to people. Collaborations are when you work with companies on a marketing campaign for their products or service. A collaboration could include free product in exchange for an Instagram review or huge paid campaigns where you create content for your blog, Instagram and YouTube on a consistent basis for a company.&nbsp;

As a new blogger I joined a few programs that help connect influencers with companies that want collaborations and I did a lot of collaborations in exchange for free product. Now that I am a bit more established I negotiate and get paid for almost every collaboration that I do. Right now, these are a BIG part of my income though they take up a lot of my time because I always have to go looking for new collaborations.&nbsp;

The last way that bloggers make money online is through online products.&nbsp;
