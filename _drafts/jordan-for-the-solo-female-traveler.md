Hey ladies. This one's for you. Today I want to share what my experience was like traveling through Jordan solo.

When I went to the middle east, I got A LOT of questions. Everyone wanted to know how safe it was, if I was alone, where I was going. And honestly, at first I was so scared but like anywhere else I have gone, as soon as I stepped off the plane I fell in love.

There is something about Jordan that was just magical. There were times I felt like I was back in India and there were also times when I felt like I was on one of the Star Wars planets. Who feels me?

A few things I want to say about Jordan starting out:

I never felt unsafe.

The people were some of the kindest in the entire world

The views were unreal OMG

Food rocked - even though sometimes it was a struggle for a non meat eater

I 100% recommend going and staying WAY longer than I did, because I did not stay long enough

So let’s get busy with what my trip was really like. I want to give you all the juice on where I stayed, where I ate, how I got around and more.

First things first - How I got to Jordan.

I crossed the border through Israel by bus. I was going to try to go it on my own but let me tell you, the bus was SO much easier. And knowing me, the bus was also cheaper. Because I would have screwed things up, taken 400 taxis and been ripped off. So off to the bus it was. Here’s the link to the bus - https://abrahamtours.com/theme/israel-jordan-shuttles/ Not sponsored, just honestly THE best option and as far as right now, the only bus around that will take you to Jordan.

Now first things first. Getting on the bus. You grab the bus from Nazareth and it leaves in the morning. I recommend staying in Nazareth and then heading to the bus station in the morning. The bus stop is across from the Mcdonalds in the center of town in Nazareth. It’s pretty easy to find. I walked there in the morning. Easy peasy.

My bus was pretty empty. I had plenty of space to myself and I was enjoying the ride over to Jordan.

Next up, the border crossing. Now the border crossing is a long process. And make sure that you have cash. You have to pay fees when you are leaving Israel and when you are entering Jordan. I exchanged the rest of my Israeli money for Jordanian Dinars at the border because why not. This way I could pay for my Jordanian Visa in cash. (They do take card though but I sometimes get nervous that my card won’t work or that it will get denied and then what?)

Heading into Jordan was pretty comical. The people there are so nice. They were slightly concerned that I was coming solo, which is pretty typical for me (even the UK gets concerned when I travel solo). The man at immigration offered to let me stay with his family, however staying at the border didn’t seem ideal.
