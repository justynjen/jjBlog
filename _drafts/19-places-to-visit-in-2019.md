Every year I sit down and think of all the places that I would love to travel to in the coming months. Sometimes I visit them all, sometimes I only visit one or two. This year I am making it my goal to really spend more time traveling and creating amazing content. Whether you get to take one vacation a year or spend all your time traveling like I do, I want to help you decide where you are going to go in 2019.

## Here’s my 19 Places to visit in 2019!
{: .present-before-paste}

#### Georgia&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

Georgia is a stunning country with an amazing visa of 365 days on arrival for Americans. I can’t tell you why I’ve never been before! The prices are great and it’s an extremely untouched place for people looking to travel to Europe this year. Next time you’re planning a holiday, make sure to consider Georgia.
{: .present-before-paste}

##### Where to Visit in Georgia
{: .present-before-paste}

Tbilisi- The capital of Georgia and one of the best cities in Georgia to visit. Make sure that you walk through the colorful old town, rich with history as Tbilisi has been the capital of Georgia since the 5th century. Getting to Tbilisi is extremely easy. You can find helpful information about the public transportation in Georgia [here.](https://www.journalofnomads.com/georgia-budget/){: target="_blank"} Wondering where to stay in Tbilisi?

{: .present-before-paste}

Mtskheta - Mtskheta is the religious capital and spiritual heart of Georgia. That’s what makes it such an important city to visit on your trip through Georgia. (It’s also one of the oldest cities in Georgia and was the capital before it was switched). Wondering where to stay in Mtskheta?

#### Latvia
{: .present-before-paste}

I’ve been to Latvia once before and would really love to go back! I want to travel back with my blogger friend Bri from [A Little Piece of Bri Elise](https://alittlepieceofbrielise.com){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; because she speaks fluent Russian and has been teaching me quite a lot. I want to go somewhere that I can practice my new skill and Latvia seems like the perfect choice.
{: .present-before-paste}

##### Where to visit in Latvia &nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

My top recommendation for visiting Latvia is to see the colorful capital Riga. This city is full of picturesque architecture, trendy cafes and buzzing bars. Looking for a room in Riga?

Jurmala - Just a 20 minute drive from Riga you have to check out this seaside resort unlike any other. This is your chance to get back to nature as you stroll through the pine fringed shoreline.

#### Zimbabwe

Another stunning country in Africa.

Iran is the number one country that I want to go to in the entire world. I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about the people, the culture and the scenery. I don’t know how I am going to get there but I know this year I want to make it happen.
{: .present-before-paste}

The best option for visiting Iran for Americans can be found with Intrepid Travel. I have heard amazing things from their trips and may even take one myself this year. No matter what country you are from, these tours through Iran with Intrepid are incredible.

{: .present-before-paste}

Always a fun country to visit with amazing food, great beaches and unbeatable cities.
{: .present-before-paste}

Top Cities to visit in Portugal include Lisbon, for the history, great Pastel de Nata and perfectly tiled old city. I recommend starting your trip to Portugal in Lisbon before heading south to explore more of the country. [Book a stay in Lisbon here.](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2167973&amp;aid=1624497&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1){: target="_blank"}
{: .present-before-paste}

After spending a couple of days in Lisbon you can head south to Porto where you can see the stunning cliff sides and pristine beaches. I recommend staying at least a few days because believe me, when you get there you aren’t ever going to want to leave. [Find a room here.](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2173088&amp;aid=1624497&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA){: target="_blank"}

#### Malta &nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

A great place to visit for sun, sea and culture, Malta has just recently popped up on my radar. In this last year I met someone from Malta and he sold me on adding it to my bucket list right away.

{: .present-before-paste}

#### Tibet
{: .present-before-paste}

This region of the world is something that I’ve dreamed of visiting. Aptly named the roof of the world, I’ve dreamed of trekking the Himalayas, seeing a new culture and way of life way up high in the world.
{: .present-before-paste}

#### Nepal
{: .present-before-paste}

Nepal has been another country that has been calling to me for years. I’ve heard nothing but absolutely amazing things about Nepal and I hope this year can be the year I finally trek the to Everest Base Camp. That would be a huge accomplishment to tick off my bucket list. If you are looking to visit Nepal, I highly recommend starting your trip in Kathmandu but getting into the mountains as soon as possible because the views look like nothing I’ve ever seen. [Book a room in Kathmandu here.](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-1022136&amp;aid=1624497&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA){: target="_blank"}

{: .present-before-paste}

#### Myanmar &nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

I was meant to go to Myanmar just two years ago but my trip plans fell through. I hope to change that this year with the chance to visit this unique country. There’s been a lot of controversy about travel to Myanmar but I encourage you to read this article by the [Wayfaress](https://www.thewayfaress.com/blog/myanmar-travel-boycott){: target="_blank"} if you were at all questioning a trip, and keep in mind that when traveling to countries like Myanmar, keep your money in the hands of the locals.

{: .present-before-paste}

#### Guatemala&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

A wonderful friend of mine, [Taylor,](https://remotelikeme.com){: target="_blank"} lives in Guatemala and she’s always posting the coolest pictures and telling me stories of everything she gets up to over there.

If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Antigua, [check here!](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-1131627&amp;aid=1624497&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA){: target="_blank"}
{: .present-before-paste}

#### Faroe Islands
{: .present-before-paste}

Words can’t describe how stunning the Faroe Islands are. I’ve had dreams of exploring the rugged landscape and since I will already have my trekking boots on, why not visit these Islands as well. When traveling to the Faroe islands make sure that you visit Saksun Church, Streymoy, Mulafossur Waterfall (Vagar Island) and Lake S&oslash;rv&aacute;gsvatn, Suduroy but honestly there is so much to see here you are going to feel like you need WAY more time to explore.
{: .present-before-paste}

#### Argentina &nbsp;

My grandparents lived in Argentina for a few years and I’ve wanted to go and visit because they have told me absolutely amazing stories about their time there.

The Hawaiian Islands honestly can’t be beat. I’ve never been to Hawaii personally but I have just always wanted to go. From the gorgeous white beaches to the lush green forests and towering waterfalls, there’s so much to see on each island, I better just plan on spending the whole year there ;) For me, I dream of going to Kauai and Maui.
{: .present-before-paste}

#### Cape Town

The raddest blogger I know lives in Cape Town and her photos are always drool worthy. To get inspired make sure that you [check out her blog.](https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-cape-town-travel-guide/){: target="_blank"} My favorite thing about her guide for Cape Town is all the handy information that she gives you right from the start.

I promise you’ll have a ticket booked to Cape Town as soon as you see her photos. This year I hope to get the chance to finally check it out for myself.
