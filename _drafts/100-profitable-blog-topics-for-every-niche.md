There are no limits to what you can blog about. However, there is an art to creating a profitable blog. In order to run a blog that makes a profit, you have to plan. You can have to put thought and effort into your blog. Believe me, I know. My blog didn't turn a profit for over 3 years because I wasn't doing any of that. I was just blogging for me and never for my audience. Not to mention I NEVER picked a niche. I just blogged about what came to mind that day. Doing this lend me to never develop an audience or make money on this platform.

I've finally switched my focus to running a profitable blog and for the first time in 3 years of blogging, I am seeing income from this and I am loving it. That's why I want to help you pick a topic for your blog, or a niche, that's going to help you be profitable as well.&nbsp;

**A few questions that you could ask yourself about profitable blog niches are:**&nbsp;

1. How do blogs make money?
2. Why does your blog topic matter when it comes to making money?
3. What are the TOP blog niches that other people are using?
4. [How do I start a profitable blog?](/the-ultimate-guide-to-starting-a-profitable-blog/)
5. What blogs make the most money?
6. What blog niches are the most popular on Google and Pinterest?

I want to cover a few of these things&nbsp;
