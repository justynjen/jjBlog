Do you love Pinterest? Are you on Pinterest on a daily basis? Would you like a new side hustle that helps you bring in a little more cash from home? Do you get excited about learning something new and being challenged in what you do?&nbsp;

Surprise, I've got the perfect opportunity for you and NO it doesn't involve selling things to your friends and family, spending all day on the phone or filling out surveys, I promise!&nbsp;

For those of you who didn't already know, I work online as a Pinterest Manager and Strategist. It's something that I have been so lucky to do for the past year and I've learned so much about how to create a genuine strategy to help people succeed and see real growth come from their Pinterest accounts. (But let's be honest, you're not here to read about how I've already made it, you're here to find out how you can make it!)

> This page contains useful resources to help you live and work while traveling. Nobody's paid me to include anything, they're just the things I use everyday, however I do receive a small commission if you buy something via these links (at no extra cost to you!) It all helps me run this site, thanks for your support!

I've traveled full time for the past 3 and a half (going on 4 years now!) And I can tell you that a lot of my success has come from being able to work on Pinterest. It's been a total game changer for me.&nbsp;

Working online as a Pinterest Manager is in high demand right now. Not only do bloggers use Pinterest, but so do business owners. Growth on Pinterest right now is exponential and you're just in time to jump on the band wagon.&nbsp;

##### So what does a Pinterest VA do?

A Pinterest VA offers Pinterest management services. Millions and millions of people around the world use Pinterest every single day. Pinterest is very time consuming for someone who is building a business. That is where people like you and I come in. We can save the day for the business owner by taking over their day to day Pinterest tasks, from designing pins to scheduling pins to applying to group boards and optimizing their account, you will help generate massive traffic to their business from Pinterest. The best part is, you can do all this while working from anywhere in the world, like I do.&nbsp;

General day to day tasks for a Pinterest Manager include pinning for your clients, designing viral pins and gauging and understanding their analytics to help them succeed. There's a lot of strategy that goes into helping someone maximise their business on Pinterest and that's why I've created the Pinterest Playbook Course. I've spent the entire last year learning directly from Pinterest in various classes and webinars how to help others and myself succeed and I've generated all of that knowledge into the Pinterest Playbook.&nbsp;

In the Pinterest Playbook Course you learn:&nbsp;

* Start with technical training about Pinterest and Tailwind
* Then we talk about Pin design, making sure that your pins are well designed and bound to go viral.&nbsp;
* What tools you should be using
* How to pitch yourself to clients and educate clients about why they should be working on Pinterest
* What services to offer and how much to charge (including real life examples from my business)

* Where to look for clients how to pitch them (with templates!)

* How to interview and onboard new clients

* Invoicing and contract tips and tricks

* How to read analytics and client reporting

* And much, much more!

The biggest question I get is if this course is worth it.. Well take it from a couple of my students.&nbsp;

"Justyn’s Pinterest course is amazing! We invited her to a blogger retreat to talk about the importance of Pinterest for a business. I have personally implemented her teaching to my Pinterest and I just hit 1.1 Million Monthly Viewers on Pinterest! We have now received a lot more traffic to our blog and our overall business! Thank YOU Justyn!"

AND

"Justyn literally changed the game for me when it comes to Pinterest marketing! Before her training, I was trying to navigate Pinterest all on my own and failing miserably. I have implemented the things she taught and my Pinterest has grown from 2k monthly engaged to over 1.1M in less than 3 months! My blog traffic has increased as a result and I will be forever grateful for Justyn’s expertise!"

From 2 of my first ever students.&nbsp;
