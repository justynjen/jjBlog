Do you love Pinterest? Are you on Pinterest on a daily basis? Would you like a new side hustle that helps you bring in a little more cash from home? Do you get excited about learning something new and being challenged in what you do?&nbsp;

Surprise, I've got the perfect opportunity for you and NO it doesn't involve selling things to your friends and family, spending all day on the phone or filling out surveys, I promise!&nbsp;

For those of you who didn't already know, I work online as a Pinterest Manager and Strategist. It's something that I have been so lucky to do for the past year and I've learned so much about how to create a genuine strategy to help people succeed and see real growth come from their Pinterest accounts. (But let's be honest, you're not here to read about how I've already made it, you're here to find out how you can make it!)

> This page contains useful resources to help you live and work while traveling. Nobody's paid me to include anything, they're just the things I use everyday, however I do receive a small commission if you buy something via these links (at no extra cost to you!) It all helps me run this site, thanks for your support!

I've traveled full time for the past 3 and a half (going on 4 years now!) And I can tell you that a lot of my success has come from being able to work on Pinterest. It's been a total game changer for me.&nbsp;

Working online as a Pinterest Manager is in high demand right now. Not only do bloggers use Pinterest, but so do business owners. Growth on Pinterest right now is exponential and you're just in time to jump on the band wagon.&nbsp;

##### So what does a Pinterest VA do?

A Pinterest VA offers Pinterest management services. Millions and millions of people around the world use Pinterest every single day. Pinterest is very time consuming for someone who is building a business. That is where people like you and I come in. We can save the day for the business owner by taking over their day to day Pinterest tasks, from designing pins to scheduling pins to applying to group boards and optimizing their account, you will help generate massive traffic to their business from Pinterest. The best part is, you can do all this while working from anywhere in the world, like I do.&nbsp;
