Dear friends and family, this is why I am a Vegan.

Why in hell did I become a Vegan? I know you are all asking this question everyday. Here it is, all the reasons, laid out so you can finally understand that this is not a phase that I am going through, this is not a passing trend, this is who I am and it's not going to change. And guess what, I don't miss cheese and I don't miss ice cream and I sure as hell don't miss meat.

There are two reasons that I gave up meat. And the first reason was animal cruelty. In America, you don't see where your meat has come from. You just see it neatly packaged in a grocery store or served to you on a plate with a tasty garnish. Traveling opened my eyes to the cruelty that occurs everyday in the meat and dairy industry. I saw chickens having razor blades to their feet for cock fighting rings and cows having their babies taken from them right after birth to be slaughtered. I have heard pigs cry before being taken to die and had friends break into chicken farms at night to rescue hens from horrendous conditions.

I know that one person giving up meat doesn't change any of that for animals all over the world, but that's a shitty reason not to make a difference in your own life. Did you know that every Vegan person saves on average of 200 animals a year? So it's time to stop saying that you can't make a difference because if you chose to make this change, you'd save 200 animals from a life of suffering every single year.

The second reason I gave up meat was of course, for the environment. It doesn't matter what you believe, [Climate Change is real and one of the biggest factors is the meat and dairy industry. ](https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/sustainable-diets-what-you-need-know-12-charts)

"Installment 11 of Creating a Sustainable Food Future shows that for people who consume high amounts of meat and dairy, shifting to diets with a greater share of plant-based foods could significantly reduce agricultureâ€™s pressure on the environment." This quote comes from the [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/publication/shifting-diets){: target="_blank"}. The "Creating a Sustainable Food Future" is a massive document covering the aspects of how the food we eat is changing the Earth we live on. Are you willing to give up on this planet because you keep telling yourself that you can't give up cheese?

New research shows the average American can cut his or her diet's environmental impacts in half by eating less meat and dairy. Less meat and dairy. I'm not asking you to cut out everything. I am just asking if you can try eating less. Download my Vegan Starter Kit for real and simple ways that you too can start giving up a little meat and you won't even notice a difference in your life.
