      <p>I'm Justyn and I created Justyn Jen to inspire and teach others about traveling full time, Pinterest Marketing and making more money on your blog. Iâ€™m your go to Pinterest Guru with a love for all things travel! I have been so lucky to travel the world for over 3 years supporting myself through Pinterest Marketing and Strategy for Bloggers and Businesses. Building this business has been a dream come true. I am here to tell you that you can make money blogging and even better, you can make money traveling. All this has been possible thanks to Pinterest, which is what inspired me to create my very own <a href="https://justynjen.teachable.com/courses">Pinterest Courses!</a> Make sure you check it out and all the free resources on my blog.</p>
      <p>My happiest days are spent sipping coffee at little cafes and exploring new cities around the world.</p>
