    <h5>I'm Justyn</h5>
    <p>Iâ€™m a freelancer with a passion for writing, taking photos and helping others live their best life. I share personal travel stories as well as tips for finding the best wifi, cafes and working spaces around the world. I have been traveling for just about 3 years now and have been lucky enough to fund my traveling through working remote.</p>
