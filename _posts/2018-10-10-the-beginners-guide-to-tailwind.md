However, if you aren’t yet using Pinterest, then make sure that you read my Ultimate Guide to Pinterest first! It’s important that you are growing your Pinterest, then it’s not going to help you to start on Tailwind.

#### What is Tailwind for Pinterest?
{: .present-before-paste}

Tailwind is the Pinterest marketing toolkit for bloggers and online businesses. This scheduler is the official partner of Pinterest. This means that it won’t get shut down like other schedulers have. Tailwind helps you drive your leads, traffic and sales from Pinterest and once you have things set up, it’s actually pretty easy to do.
{: .present-before-paste}

When you are using Tailwind, you don’t have to find time to pin daily. You can sit down once a week and let Tailwind post for you. They even create a smart schedule, making sure that you pin at the best times of day for you.
{: .present-before-paste}

Along with a perfect schedule, Tailwind also offers analytics that show you what content is really resonating with you audience. This way you can make more content that people are looking for and try improving content that isn’t working for you.

#### How does Tailwind work?

When you sign up for Tailwind, you just have to link your Pinterest account. Once you are signed up, Tailwind starts analyzing your account to help you create your smart schedule and allow you to pin when it’s best for you and your engagement. It also starts to give you analytics to track your audience and content.
{: .present-before-paste}

It’s so easy to set up your schedule. All you have to do is let Tailwind know how many times a day that you want to pin. You pick as many pins as you want. Then you have to fill your queue and Tailwind will do the rest of the work for you.
{: .present-before-paste}

##### There are a few different ways that you can add pins to Pinterest.
{: .present-before-paste}

1. Schedule them from Pinterest and add them to your queue.
2. Schedule them directly from your website.
3. Upload pins directly to Tailwind in a similar way that you do on Pinterest.

If you want to pin using the top 2 options, you have to add the Tailwind extension to your browser. Once you have that installed, you just have to hover over the image that you want to save and click the Tailwind button and you can save anything you want.
{: .present-before-paste}

When you want to add a pin to more than one board, you should first add your pin to the most relevant boards. You can add a pin to as many boards as you want. Now when you add a pin to more than one board, I recommend that you use an interval so that pins go out to Pinterest on different days and at different times. This can help so that you don’t spam your page and boards all at once.
{: .present-before-paste}

Once you’re done, just hit schedule pins and you’re all set!

#### How does Tailwind help you grow your followers and engagement?
