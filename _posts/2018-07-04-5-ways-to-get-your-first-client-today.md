Well you’ve decided to be a freelancer. Good for you! Now you are on the magical journey of trying to figure out how you can start getting clients. Let’s talk for a quick second about the places that I do not recommend going for these clients.

&nbsp;

1. Upwork - Listen, I don’t care what anyone else had told you, it sucks. They take 20% of your money - which is a ton in the grand scheme of things. They don’t pay you until you have $100 and they don’t protect you if you do the work and the client suddenly decided they don’t need it anymore. They just say, oh well, you did all that work for nothing. See yah. Your money in Escrow will just head straight back into that clients account. BUH BYE. So no thanks, I am done getting screwed over by Upwork. Not to mention, clients on there want cheap work. They don’t want to pay for quality.
2. Guru - got totally screwed out of $2,000 because my client disappeared and they did nothing to help me.
3. Fiverr - nothing I do is worth $5. NOTHING.

&nbsp;

Alright that’s enough of that. Let’s talk about 5 ways that you can start getting real, legit clients today!

&nbsp;

First things first join some Facebook groups and start being active in them right away! Don’t spam people because they will hate you, but find ways to be active. Ask for feedback, give feedback. Participate. Post pictures of your dogs. The more people know you, the more likely they are to recommend or hire you!

&nbsp;

Secondly, customize your resume! Every job you apply for should get a customized resume and cover letter. Do you have no idea what I am talking about? Go ahead and talk to Taylor at Remote Like Me. She created a course just for this. You can sign up today and start applying better tomorrow.

&nbsp;

Third, make sure that you are following people directions. If they say to email them and in the header tell them your dogs name and then to forward that to your second aunt and then tell them what your favorite starbucks beverage is and why. THEN DO IT. You have a way better chance of standing out when you actually take the time to follow people’s directions.

&nbsp;

Fourth, make sure that you put together samples of your work. Don’t have any samples? Go offer to do something for someone for free to get a sample. Don’t want to do that? That’s okay, go and do stuff for yourself. I started a blog for several reasons:

&nbsp;

1. Website example - shows people my web dev skills
2. Writing examples - tons of content on here that i have written!
3. Graphics and photography examples
4. Stats! This one is the most important. I have good stats for my own blog - which then shows people what I can do for them! Holla!

&nbsp;

Now finally, to start getting clients right away, you need to be applying, A LOT. A friend once told me that I will hear back on 1 in 10 applications. That’s the truest thing that I have ever been told. So how do you battle this? You apply, a lot!

A little last thing, I am going to link some resources where you can find legit jobs to apply to, without having to use Facebook Groups alone or sites like Upwork!
