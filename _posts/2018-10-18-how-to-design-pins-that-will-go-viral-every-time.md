For me, Pinterest is a major source of blog traffic. When you use Pinterest as a Search Engine, instead of a social media platform you can really explode your traffic. In order to really succeed on Pinterest though, you're pins have to stand out from the rest. You need to design viral pins that stand out from the millions of pins that get uploaded to the platform everyday. 

The Pinterest Smart feed can tell when pins are designed well and how they perform. Having beautiful images is really important but is it enough? There's actually a real science behind creating the perfect pin that will lead to repins and go viral generating tons of clicks back to your website. 

In this guide I am going to teach you everything you need to know about creating the perfect viral pin; what you need to include in your pin, what Pinterest recommends for you and and what works vs what doesn't. 

Are you ready to create Viral Pins?

### Creating Viral Pins

#### Step 1: Size

You always need to be creating vertical pins. Vertical pins align well in the grid columns that Pinterest organizes. If you create small and square pins I can promise you that no one will ever see them or share them. Now, Pinterest recommends that you use a 2:3 ratio for your pins. This means that your pins should be 1.5 times at long as they are wide.The optimal pin size is 600 x 900 pixels but I make them a little longer when I need to.

\*\* It's important to keep in mind that Pinterest will cut pins off around 1260 pixels now though. This simply means that the user won't see the whole pin unless they click it for the close up view.

There used to be no limit to pin length and bloggers would make pins that dominated the feed, so Pinterest has limited the visible length to combat that.

#### Step 2: Images

I use a mixture of pins that are just text and that have images. When you are using images for your pins, make sure that the images are completely [royalty free](https://unsplash.com/){: target="_blank"}, you can easily find images to use on[ stock image sites.](https://unsplash.com/){: target="_blank"} Also, make sure that your images are related to the topic that you are sharing.

When I am picking images for my pins I try to pick images that are clean and bright. I want my images to stand out and be appealing to my audience. 

#### Step 3: Text

It's important that the text on your pin is readable. You want something that stands out and gets people to stop scrolling. I also recommend that you never use more than 2 fonts for your text overlay or pin. You can use a San Serif and a Serif font to mix things up. 

(I've personally noticed that bold san serif fonts perform better. They tend to stand out more and catch the users eye, plus they are clean and extremely easy to read.)

An important thing to remember when you are creating pins is that around 75% of Pinterest users are searching from their phones. So make sure that the text is big enough and readable on a phone as well as on a computer. 

Try not to cram too much into one pin. Just give people an appealing enough title to make them want to click to your website.

Please don't forget to also fill out the pin description when you are adding a pin to Pinterest! So many people don't fill this spot in and it's such valuable real estate for your Pinterest SEO. 

#### Step 4: Branding

When it comes to creating your pins for Pinterest, it is so important to not only create each pin, but to also create your brand. You want people to recognize your pins before they even read them because they are on brand for you. This will help you to build up your loyal and loving fan base. 

Use the same fonts, colors and similar images for every pin. PLUS it's very important that you add your logo/name/website to every pin that you create. If the pin is broken and people really want to read your article, at least then they will know where to find it! 

I strongly recommend creating Pin Templates. This will help you save time and easily create cohesive pins. If you don't have time or don't have a great eye for design, don't worry [you can still buy the designs I created for you](https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook){: target="_blank"} and just pop your branding in!  

I recommend that for each blog post you create, you save at least 4 pins. This way you can see what designs perform the best for your audience and you have a better chance of reaching more people because you have multiple designs for each pin. On each pin you can try a different headline, tagline, style and image and chances are, you might even have more than one go viral! I was recently watching a Pinterest Webinar that said having at least 4 pins for every blog post drastically helps your SEO for your account as well. So it can't hurt to have [10 templates](https://justynjen.teachable.com/p/pinterest-playbook){: target="_blank"} that you can reuse for every blog that you create.

P.S! To see even better results on Pinterest and to have even more pins go viral, you should enable Rich Pins. Pinterest teaches you exactly how to do that [here.](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/rich-pins/overview/?){: target="_blank"} The info you’ll provide on the image will also be used by search engines for context and indexing, and will show up on the pin as well. It's an amazing way to have viral pins lead straight back to you!
