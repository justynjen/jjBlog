I am starting a new feature on my blog called Women Crush Wednesday where once a month I am going to feature boss babes that are killing the online world. I want to feature entrepreneurs that are kicking ass out there in the world. This week I am featuring Taylor Lane, Founder of Remote Like Me. 

Taylor is the ultimate boss babe! She has been running Remote Like Me for over a year now. It's a company that helps woman of all careers go remote. She does one on one coaching for women but she also has a series of memberships that you can join where she will help you on different levels for people with different needs. 

She has a 3 month road map for success. This means that in just 3 months she will take you from 0 to remote working hero in just 3 months. Taylor's goal is to help as many women go remote as possible. She's a remote queen!

So what's Taylor's story:

"My mind used to be made up too. I will dread going to work every day for the rest of my life.<br>Let’s face it, that’s just normal… SMACK!<br>I can’t believe I ever thought about life that way. Here’s the story of how it all changed.

In 2014 I had the opportunity to travel to Guatemala and volunteer with people with special needs. As soon as I saw the world through eyes other than my own, a light switched on inside of me. From that moment on, teaching within the same four walls every day did not bring me joy. After returning to Guatemala many times, I knew I needed to find a way to fund a lifestyle centered around travel. There was one small problem. I had no idea where to start.

So I did what any bright, blonde, 22 year old girl would do. In 2015, I moved to Central America to figure it out. I spent my days exploring, my nights bartending, and any waking moment I had left on researching the remote lifestyle. I applied to a handful of remote jobs and luckily landed one with an email marketing company. I had set myself free! I spent the next year of my life working from my laptop and traveling the world. Mexico, Lithuania, Colombia, Morocco, Spain, the list goes on. Friends, family, and straight up strangers wanted to know how it’s done. I saw so many deserving people with a strong desire to work remotely with no idea where to start out. I had to do something…

I experimented by sending a few newsletters, listing remote job opportunities in various industries and the results were insane! People started applying and landing jobs right away. I was screaming with joy (literally) and knew I could continue to help people all over the world. Now I run memberships, create courses, and write guides on how to find remote jobs.

I’ve been helping girls like you go remote like me since January, 2017."

Now Tay is going to keep changing lives and helping girls making their dreams a reality hopefully forever! If you are interested in working with Taylor,[check out her site](http://remotelikeme.com). Her membership is only open for a limited time, so get in while you can.

Taylor runs 3 memberships, each for people at a different level of their remote job search! She has a [monthly weekly roundup](http://remotelikeme.com/join) where she sends you weekly jobs that she hand picks for members. She has the [Remote Like Us membership](http://remotelikeme.com/join) where she has video trainings, pdfs and you still get those weekly emails. Lastly, she has the [VIP membership](http://remotelikeme.com/join) where you get everything I've already listed plus resume checks, interview help and group coaching! This is the ultimate resource for getting a remote career.
