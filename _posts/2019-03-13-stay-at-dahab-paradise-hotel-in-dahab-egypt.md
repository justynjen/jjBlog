# Having the perfect stay at Dahab Paradise

I spent 10 days in Dahab getting dive certified and while there I had the chance to stay at a couple different hotels and a hostel. The best place that I had the chance to stay at in Dahab was the Dahab Paradise hotel. I was so lucky to be able to spend my last 4 nights in Dahab here and I almost skipped by bus back to Cairo because I loved it so much.&nbsp;

Here's everything you need to know about staying at the Dahab Paradise Hotel in Dahab, Egypt.&nbsp;

## Getting to Dahab Paradise

The best way to get to Dahab Paradise is to take a taxi from the bus station. As for the taxi, you shouldn’t pay more than 40 LE. I usually paid anywhere from 25-30 LE but sometimes I ended up paying 40 LE. As for getting back to the city center, the hotel staff will happily organize that for you.

While in Dahab I was so lucky to be able to stay for a few nights at Dahab Paradise. Aptly named, Dahab Paradise is an oasis of greenery, peaceful nights and a stunning pool which was my favorite part! Unfortunately it rained while I was in Dahab so I wasn’t able to enjoy the pool as much as I would have hoped but I loved waking up every morning with views of the pool and palm trees overlooking the ocean.

## Sleep

The rooms at Dahab Paradise are warm and cozy. When you are ready to take a shower, you should turn on the hot water about 10 minutes before and then turn it back off after. The switch is super easy to use in the bathroom and the shower was nice.

My favorite part about the room though was the bed. The beds at Dahab Paradise were HUGE. I looked forward to getting into bed every night and dreaded getting back out by the time morning came around. The only thing that got me out of bed in the morning was the breakfast (and the diving!

## Activities

The staff at Dahab Paradise are happy to help you organize any activity that you might want to do during your stay. Some of the things you might want to do in Dahab includes Diving, Hiking the Mountains & Desert, Snorkeling Trips, Bedouin Tea/Barbeque trips and more.

Unfortunately while I was in Dahab I wasn’t able to spend much time in the desert and mountians. Diving was so exhausting that by the time I got home everyday, all I could think to do was sleep. I highly recommend hiking Mount Sinai for Sunrise. I wasn’t able to do it during my visit but a friend showed me pictures which looked amazing and well worth it. Ask at the reception for the hotel staff to help you book.

## Eat & Drink

Dahab Paradise has a 24/7 restaurant with lots to choose from. My favorite was their Guava juice, topped with apples and banana. You can order from a series of quick eats and full meals anytime of day.

I had their breakfast everyday, with Foul and Falafel, Pita and loads of fresh fruits and veggies. They also had an omelet bar.

From the restaurant I also had the veggie pizza and Falafel wrap. All the food turned out to be amazing. I was so impressed with the staff all around Dahab Paradise.

The only downside that I found with the hotel was the wi-fi. They had 3 wi-fi routers but none of them had good connection and I had a really hard time getting my work done in my room or by the pool. If your there for a holiday though and you don’t have to work, your stay will be perfect. If you are like me and you need to work while visiting as well, I recommend getting a sim you can hotspot or working at my favorite place downtown, which you can read all about here.
