One of the hardest things about blogging is keeping up with consistent content, writing often (even when you have writer's block) and producing content that your readers are going to love. This can get overwhelming especially when you are traveling, responding to emails, taking + editing photos and videos and still trying to enjoy your trip. That’s why I find it so important to plan out your content in advance. This year, I actually managed to plan out the year’s worth of content at once. I will still create new things as I go, but I have my core blog content prepared for the year and I want to teach you how you can do the same!

Once you have your core content prepared, you can write multiple blog posts and then save them for throughout the year. This way you always have something to post and it won’t be something that you’ve just put together because you forgot that you always post on Sundays or you’ve put it off too much and know that you just need to post anything. When you put content out there that is thrown together or not useful, then it will do your audience no good which won’t help you either.

<br>This guide is meant to help you plan/get ideas for a years worth of content.  

##### How to begin putting together your content for the year.

#####  

#### Know your goals and limitations.

Gone are the days of bloggers posting content everyday. Your blog followers are not going to have time to read your content everyday (nor are they going to want too). I post on my blog 2 days a week, which brings me in a consistent amount of traffic while still allowing me to create extremely high quality content for my readers.

With this being said, my goal for 2019 was to post 8 times a month. I always post all of my blogs before Thursday. I have personally found that I get the most engagement on Sundays and Wednesdays, but make sure that you are finding the days that work for you and sticking with it.

If posting 1 day a week is what works for you, then make sure you know what blogs you are going to be posting for the month, this way when you are feeling inspired, you can sit down and write multiple posts at once and then go back and edit them at once and be done!

#### Always plan ahead!

I start planning my content in my google drive (I use google drive for everything!) I recommend that you open a new google sheet and organize it to be your blog content for the entire year. I always start by breaking it down into Q1, Q2 and Q3. (You can do this by creating new pages within 1 sheet)

Quarter One covers January, February, March and April. During January I always post my new year content. Bucket lists and goals for the year. Reflections on the year before/year ahead and productivity/success/goals posts.

Depending on what your blog is about, February can be about Trips to escape winter, valentines or fashion trends (a lot of fashion weeks happen in February). March/April can be about Spring. Things like Spring cleaning, spring trips to take, spring fashion/makeup trends.

**Some great content ideas to keep in mind:**

* Holiday Content - those must read holiday gift guides - why not plan to post those in November and get working on them to make them the best resource ever?
* Seasonal Travel - Summer Break, Spring Break, Winter Break
* A launch that you might have coming up is a great way to plan content. Prior to a launch all of your content should be educational about what you are launching.
* Fashion Weeks - if you are a fashion blogger
* Seasonal Food trends if you are a food blogger
* Outdoor vs Indoor workouts if you are a fitness blogger.

Once you start looking at the year like this, it’s much easier to plan what you will be posting and when.

If you’re still confused, let me help. I will share my Q1 content plans.

For January I planned to share bucket list ideas for the new year as well as things like this blog content planning post. I wanted to share with my audience how they can start preparing for the amazing year ahead of them and how I could help with that.

For February I already knew what my travel plans were going to be so my content is centered around where I am going to be exploring and in March I am launching my first webinar so you can guess what that content is going to be about! Through the end of February and March I will be preparing content to lead people to join my free webinar and then in April I will return to a few backlog blogging posts and travel posts that I haven’t gotten the chance to write about yet.

Then you just have to think about what is happening the rest of the year. Quarter two blogs can be all about summer trends in travel, fashion or blogging. They can be affiliate posts with favorite products, summer blogging tips/blogging gear, summer photography and more.

As you go into Quarter 3 it’s time to start planning your holiday content. You should be posting your holiday content at least one month in advance so you can follow fall trends and then jump right into things like gift guides, holiday travel and holiday bites. The holidays are a great time to share content so make sure that you plan accordingly and get your content out with plenty of time before the shopping and trip planning starts.

If you still aren’t sure where to start, or you just can’t seem to banish writer’s block then make sure you keep an eye out here because my next post will be 5,000+ blog post ideas for EVERY niche that you can start using today!

#### Staying organized

I wanted to share with you a few final tips on how you can stay organized while you are preparing your content for the year.

* Make sure that you put everything into the google spreadsheet.
* Add dates so you know when posts need to go live.
* If you have bulk written posts for the year then make sure you link them in google drive so you don’t lose them and so you can go back and edit them.
* Set aside time to bulk write when you are in the zone. It’s a great way to pump out amazing content but remember that you need to go back and edit your content for mistakes.
* If you need inspiration, you can link those in a separate page of your google drive for reading and inspiration.
* Do lots of keyword research and make plenty of pins so that your blogs get the traffic that they deserve! If you are really organized you can also include this information in your google sheet as well!

The most important thing is that you stick to your goals and post when you’ve said you are going to. This way you will be able to stay on top of you blogging and not drown or get burned out with overload. Having a consistent blogging schedule is also how I’ve managed to significantly grow my blogs traffic so I know it would help you as well.

Good luck planning your content for the year, I can’t wait to see what you come up with.
