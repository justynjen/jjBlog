I'm turning 23 this week so I thought I would write a fun post for all of my new followers with **23 things that you might not know about me! **

My name is pronounced just(in)

I'm the middle child of 3. 

I have been traveling full time almost 3,5 years now and time has FLOWN by

Last year while living in Bali I completely ran out of money, maxed out my credit card and taught myself how to work online so I didn't have to come home

I have visited over 50 countries, all before turning 23. I hope to visit several more before turning 24!

I am from Utah, but I did spend part of my childhood in Texas!

I am a HUGE book nerd and used to read under the covers with a flashlight at night. (My mom even got in trouble with my school when I was little because they thought she was letting me read too mature of books i.e. Eragon when I was in the 4th grade)

I've been skydiving and paragliding but I am WAY too scared to bungee jump

I used to be a HORRIBLE cook. Seriously ask my family. One time I tried to thicken mac and cheese by putting flour in it and another time I couldn't find baking powder so I thought powered sugar would be a good substitute. But when I became Vegan I made it my goal to learn how to cook delicious food for myself and I have gotten so much better. 😊

My second toe is my longest toe and growing up my dad tormented me by calling me long toe (because apparently this is unnatural) - to the point where I refused to wear sandals until very recently 

The first foreign country I ever went to was Russia. And I was terrified. I haven't been back but would actually love to visit a few friends I have that live there.

I got a tattoo in a skate park/bar in Bali. And yes it's of a band-aid. (I want to get dinosaurs 🐱‍🐉 tattooed on it so people stop thinking it's a skateboard)

My favorite place in the world is Japan because their toilets are incredible

I have mushrooms 🍄 tattooed on the back of my calf and I tell everyone it's because I like to take trips (pun intended 😂)

When I left home I couldn't read a map. My first year abroad I spent more time lost than anything else

I work online as a Pinterest Marketer WHICH is how I fund my travels. I am not a sugar baby but I sure wish I was. The most money my parents have given me to travel was $100 back when I ran out of money in Bali.

My dream vacation is anywhere with a private white sand beach which is why I am celebrating 23 in the Seychelles!

I've been politely asked to leave Europe for accidentally over staying my Schengen Visa. (They were very understanding because apparently it happens a lot)

Before embarking on this dream chasing adventure I worked as a Care Assistant in Nursing Homes and Hospice for over 4 years and my dream was to be a nurse. (It was my parents who encouraged me to put school on hold)

I hate wearing shoes inside. I will always slip my shoes off when I go inside someones house even when they stop me to tell me I don't have too. I can't wear shoes indoors.

I once called my dad just to have someone to talk to while I tried to wash a spider down the drain, which took me over half an hour and an entire bottle of hairspray. (When I went to Australia I used to check my whole room for the creepy buggers every night before sleeping) Also I probably won't sleep tonight because now I'm thinking about them.

I love doing laundry - especially folding laundry.

Almost every time I fly I imagine the plane blowing up like in Final Destination yet my favorite thing to do is fly… ✈
