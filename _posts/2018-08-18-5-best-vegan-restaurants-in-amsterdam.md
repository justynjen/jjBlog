Eating just might be my favorite thing in the world to do. This being said, I love food so going vegan has its ups and downs. Ice Cream is harder to find, sushi is nearly impossible and trying the local cuisine when I travel isn’t always an option. However, more and more cities have their favorites popping up in some of the tastiest vegan versions ever. I’ve made it my mission to find those restaurants and basically eat the entire menu before leaving the city. Check out what my 5 favorite vegan restaurants in Amsterdam were!

#### The Meatless District&nbsp;

Just make sure that you make a reservation. It was very busy. There menu is 100% so I’d always just say try it all! Cause how often do you get those chances right? To me the BLT is most appealing cause that’s just something that doesn’t get recreated often.

#### Vegan Junk Food Bar

I love their loaded fries. I had the loaded Supreme and I loved every bite of it. I also loved their traditional veggie burger but that was all I had the chance to try. I could have eaten everything on the menu it was so good!

#### Holy Mac'n Cheesus&nbsp;

I LOVE MAC AND CHEESE and this was no exception! It was amazing. I actually also wish that I would have tried everything on their menu however I only tried the Return of the Mac which was AMAZING.

#### Vegabond&nbsp;

Vegabond is a must visit for any sweets. They have sandwiches and cakes galore! I love the focaccia and the spring rolls with avocado are to die for. They also have an entire shop where you can buy healthy and delicious things for your kitchen (INCLUDING ICE CREAM!).

#### Moaz&nbsp;

Perfect for those traditional chips that everyone is searching for in Amsterdam but with a wonderful selection of vegan sauces! It’s right next door to the oh so famous Mannekin Pis but I promise for Vegans - this place is SOOOO much better. And the line was WAY shorter.

#### And lastly, Stroopwafels!

And for those of you on the hunt for Stroopwafels that you can enjoy, don’t get discouraged! You can buy them at Erica in central station! And believe me, they are even better than the original. If you are willing to search, you really can find everything you want to try in a city! I hope that this foodies guide to Amsterdam has helped you realize that, even just a little.
