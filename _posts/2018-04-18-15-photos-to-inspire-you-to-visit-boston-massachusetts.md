Boston is THE city to visit for all the food, baseball and history things you could hope for in America! I could have stayed forever. I walked all along the freedom trail, ate about 13 meals a day and wandered in and out of hundreds of unique little stores. All in all, Boston was a dream come true. I hope these photos inspire you to visit Boston right away!
